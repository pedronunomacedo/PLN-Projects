      " \"Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it. \\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThis is a scenario of fiscal dominance, in which policy rates rise by much less than we expect in 2022, but macro risks â€” both inflation and external â€” could be much higher than our current baseline,â€\\x9d Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote in a Feb. 25 note. â€œWe see a potential stagflationary outcome in this scenario.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFiscal dominance occurs when the governmentâ€™s finances â€” for instance, the cost at which it borrows â€” take priority and force the monetary authorityâ€™s hand on interest rates, hurting its power to fight inflation. That isnâ€™t the case in India right now. In early May, when the fiction of transient inflation became impossible to keep up, the Indian central bank surprised the market with an unscheduled 40 basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate. It followed up Wednesday by raising the policy rate by another 50 basis points, though this time the tightening was widely expected. For now, it doesnâ€™t look like the fiscal authority is keen to dissuade the central bank from doing its job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 7.8%, the pace of annual price increases is at an eight-year high and still climbing. In other words, itâ€™s early days in Indiaâ€™s battle against inflation, and the finance ministry might yet lose its nerve if, in the process of containing price pressures, the RBI pushes up bond yields too high, complicating the governmentâ€™s plan to raise money by selling a record 14.31 trillion rupees ($184 billion) of notes this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesnâ€™t seem to be rattled. If anything, New Delhi has announced a $26 billion package, which includes tax cuts on fuel, to help the RBI keep a lid on inflation. That package is unlikely to be a substitute for more rate increases; it might even enlarge the public borrowing plan. To this, add Wednesday's increase in prices for monsoon-sown crops â€” including rice -- that the government will pay farmers to procure their harvests for public distribution. Money will have to be found for this, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has to assure New Delhi that its borrowing program would get completed without pushing the 10-year yield much higher than the current level of around 7.5%, a three-year high. The question is, can Das really hold the line on long-term bond yields? And will the government change its carefree tune if he canâ€™t. Luckily for Das, so far thereâ€™s been nothing of the 2015 bluster when, according to a recent Al Jazeera expose by The Reportersâ€™ Collective, the top bureaucrat in the finance ministry had internally sought an investigation into then Governor Raghuram Rajanâ€™s decision to keep interest rates high, by which he was allegedly helping â€œthe white manâ€\\x9d â€” shorthand for investors in rich nations â€” at the cost of domestic investment and growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Rajanâ€™s 2016 decision to return to the University of Chicago, the friction carried over to his successor. Governor Urjit Patel came under pressure on everything from interest rates â€” which by now were being decided by a monetary policy committee â€” to his management of surging corporate bad debt and, finally, the question of whether the RBI had more capital than it needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nPatelâ€™s deputy was mocked for warning the government of the consequences of raiding the RBIâ€™s coffers. Following Patelâ€™s abrupt resignation in December 2018, his job went to Das, a former finance-ministry mandarin who had executed Modiâ€™s draconian currency ban in late 2016. A new period of peaceful coexistence between the fiscal and monetary authorities began, and gained momentum during the pandemic when such cooperation became the norm globally. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, the pandemic is over, and new sources of friction are cropping up. On rate increases, the central bank and the finance ministry may be singing from the same hymn book, but the question of the RBIâ€™s capital is beginning to simmer, thanks to the lowest dividend the ministry has received from the RBI in a decade: a little less than $4 billion, or a third of last yearâ€™s payout.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucially, even this reduced dividend has been made possible by the central bank simultaneously selling $97 billion from its foreign-currency reserves in the spot market and buying $114 billion. Ignore the purchases. Each dollar thatâ€™s sold is valued its weighted average cost of acquisition in the past. Since that figure is lower than the current exchange rate, selling dollars for around 78 rupees today means a profit, which is then shared with New Delhi. Without this â€œactive conversion of revaluation gains into realized profits, the RBI would have required a net capital injection from the government,â€\\x9d according to Observatory Group analyst Ananth Narayan. \\r\\n\\r\\nA reduction in the balance sheet also helped rein in the RBIâ€™s capital requirement, and prevented its dividend from going to zero, Narayan says. That tug of war â€” whether RBI would give money to the government or tap it for funds â€” might remain in check once again if the central bankâ€™s assets donâ€™t swell this year, either. That may well be the case since thereâ€™s hardly any dollar inflow into India now, only outflow. Still, the RBIâ€™s economic capital, which according to Narayanâ€™s calculation has already dipped below the minimum 20.8% of assets set by a 2019 committee, is a mindless constraint. It would never have come about if the finance ministry didnâ€™t in the past lust after the RBIâ€™s capital. To have to depend on politicians for money isnâ€™t a good outcome for an institution that has to project its autonomy to make its war on inflation credible. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndiaâ€™s fragile government finances mean that the risk of fiscal dominance of monetary policy always lurks in the background. Right now, it isnâ€™t a big threat because inflation is giving an unexpected boost to the tax revenue. But as Nomuraâ€™s Nandi says, monetary tightening is â€œfar from the finishing line.â€\\x9d Barely two months into the job, Das cut rates in a surprise stimulus ahead of Modiâ€™s May 2019 re-election bid. That was then. Now that the cycle has turned, it will be interesting to see if the RBI chief can keep his political masters in good humor. Or if his relationship with the government â€” like that of his two predecessors â€” will also start to fray. \\r\\n\"\n",

      " 'At a time when economies across the world are finding ways for sustainable farming due to depleting groundwater levels, agri-tech solution company Gram Unnati worked closely with multiple stakeholders to help farmers in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand save 4,000 liters of water per acre by bringing climate-compatible agriculture to over 5,000 acres of farmland. \\r\\n\\r\\nGram Unnati worked closely with the local district administration, local maize processors, input companies, and lead farmers in a short span of 18 months prompting 2,000 farmers to switch to climate-compatible crops that are commercially viable as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAneesh Jain, CEO and Founder, Gram Unnati, said, â€œThe success of the project comes at a time when we are dealing with acute water shortage across the world. According to the United Nations, by 2050 more than five billion people could be affected by water scarcity. India, which constitutes 16% of the total world population, has access to a meagre 4% of the worldâ€™s water resources. The success of our pilot project in Uttarakhand will impact other farmers to shift towards climate compatible crops without having an impact on yield and returns.â€\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nFarmers of Udham Singh Nagar and adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh (Rampur, Bareilly, and Pilibhit) traditionally take up a short duration summer paddy crop after their Rabi harvest and before Kharif sowing. Based on research, Gram Unnati identified Maize as a reasonably remunerative substitute for summer paddy. Maize is not only a short-duration crop, requiring less water compared to paddy but is also known to bring higher returns. Its multiple utilities such as â€˜foodâ€™, â€˜fodderâ€™, and â€˜feedâ€™ help in de-risking farmers against potential low-demand situations. \\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe pilot project was successful in moving 5,000 acres of land to spring maize, which resulted in substantial water savings of as much as 4,000 litres per acre. The crop also generated 25 percent higher yield on the same piece of land. This has emerged as a good example of â€˜more crop per dropâ€™. The project also contributed towards fulfilment of Sustainable Development Goals like reducing poverty, increasing agricultural productivity, judicious use of water, and sustainable production,â€\\x9d added Jain.\\r\\n\\r\\nJain said that the success of the project in Udham Singh Nagar has encouraged Gram Unnati to take up newer challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œGram Unnati intends to scale up this intervention to 100,000 acres of Spring Maize in the next five years. Not only would this reduce dependency on groundwater resources, but it will also help in making agriculture more remunerative for the farmers and more sustainable for the environment,â€\\x9d Jain added. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water in India, the shift from high to low-intensity crops such as Maize, pulses, millets, oilseeds, etc. has the potential to significantly reduce farmersâ€™ dependence on rainwater/ irrigation, while helping in greater water conservation, enhancing farmersâ€™ capacity to better cope with climate change and in the long run making India more self-sufficient in these crops. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is estimated that out of total extractable groundwater available in India, 90% goes to agriculture annually to often support highly water-intensive crops like paddy, sugarcane, and wheat, sometimes in severely water stressed regions of the country. As many as 30% of districts in India have reported â€˜criticalâ€™ groundwater levels according to recent Central Ground Water Board data. The growing water crisis is being worsened by climate change with rising temperatures and uncertain rainfall patterns. \\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",

      " 'ThinkStock PhotosIn every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context.Sustainability has imploded as an agenda with unprecedented scope and significance. India\\'s movement for a Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) is now in the global spotlight as a premier initiative for nurturing a \"pro planet people\". It is emerging as a consciously tailored policy for climate change focusing on reducing consumption at an individual level. Embers of LiFE already exist in the country, and there is much to learn from India\\'s environmental history. Understanding the pivotal role of indigenous knowledge systems in preserving ecology is essential for shaping the future of Indian sustainability. Hence, the call for LiFE is about taking a walk down the memory lane, drawing lessons for India\\'s future and implementing it on a larger scale. India has also revised its starting point from state action to individual action. Now the question is, what kind of individual action will create long-standing sustainability in the country? How can we chart a new course for Indian environmentalism through indigenous knowledge and experiences from the ground? The answer is simple; launching movements from the ground and mainstreaming indigenous practices but building momentum for the same is not an easy task.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach country will play to its strengths to achieve ambitious targets, and India should also tap into its rich body of indigenous knowledge. There is no one ideal way to practice sustainability in the country. India has diverse physical and social divisions. The history, experience, and expectations of sustainability in Meghalaya will significantly differ from Kerala\\'s. The first step is toward building environmental literacy within communities. When we talk about changing individual behaviour and lifestyle for the environment, it must be noted that the individual and the collective are closely entwined for preserving the environment. Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how one\\'s life affects the community and working towards overall well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context. In 2021, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation recognised eight sustainable food systems worldwide, out of which two are from Meghalaya and Uttarakhand in India. The Khasi tribes from Nongtraw village in Meghalaya received global attention for their diverse traditional food systems like Jhum supported by livestock farming and other practices that respect local agro-biodiversity. This enabled the village to produce and consume quality yield even with supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. Similarly, the Bhotias and Anwals of Uttrakhand follow ancestral nomadism and agro-pastoralism, which helps them meet 60% of the community\\'s food consumption needs. This shows how traditional practices can build resilience in communities and aid climate adaptation efforts. We can also take the example of Indian architecture. The country is now rife with green building consultants, but historically, every part of the country had its locally suited green buildings. Dhajji Dewri in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir are traditional structures built by partially cutting mountain slopes. It is best suited for the region\\'s climatic variations while causing minimal disturbance to the topography. Today it is impossible to travel to the mountains without considering the possibility of landslides and rocks hurling down due to reckless practices. This is only a sneak peek into India\\'s depths of sustainable knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the only way to build a long-standing climate policy is by tapping into the strength of the grassroots and understanding the extent to which environmental movements can empower individuals on the ground. Chipko movement received global attention and is a landmark in the Indian environmental movement, but the starting point was at the community level. A social and yet personal struggle of Chandi Prasad Bhatt to preserve the local forest resources, escaped, connected, and thrived under the umbrella of eco feminism and peasant\\'s movement in the country. If we look at the history of environmental movements in India, be it Narmada Bachao Andolan or the Niyamgiri movement, the first call for action always comes from the ground, from a personal anecdote, because fear is not thrilling when you\\'re the one who is afraid. Also, the unique potential for LiFE lies in the fact that all humans, all Indians, are embedded and nurtured on the same earth. Besides, with increasing mobility and interconnectedness, we know the extent to which a tropical cyclone in Odisha can affect neighbouring states and communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle for Environment should therefore emanate from India\\'s pre-existing pockets of indigenous knowledge, and the rest of the country should embrace these learnings from the ground. India has the right policy ecosystem and governance support for reinventing its sustainability movement. All Indian states incentivise eco-friendly practices like organic farming, electric mobility, and renewable energy infrastructure. Adapting them to local contexts, linking sustainability with community practices and sharing best practices with the world is the way forward to build momentum for a Lifestyle for Environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmit Kapoor is chair, Institute for Competitiveness; visiting scholar and lecturer at Stanford University.

      " 'Indian corporates will have to think twice before tossing \\'guarantees\\' and \\'letters of comfort\\' to help group companies raise money, notch up credit ratings, and bargain a lower interest rate on the back of such support from parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules of the game on \\'corporate guarantees\\' will change with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) insisting on a water-tight, time-bound mechanism for the issuance of guarantees and their invocation by lending banks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a week ago, in a \"guidance note\" to credit rating agencies, the banking regulator has said that banks have to formally agree to a time frame within which they would invoke a guarantee following a loan default while the corporate guarantor has to commit to a deadline to pay up once the invocation by lenders takes place, a senior industry person told ET.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating agencies have been advised by the regulator to perform legal due diligence and ensure that the right structures and agreements are in place so that lenders, as well as borrowers, stick to a formally agreed timeline on invocation and loan repayment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA corporate guarantee is a promise by the parent to assume the debt obligation of a group company if the latter fails to repay or service a loan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Banks rarely pull the trigger soon after a default. They try to negotiate and assess the situation. They may also delay the guarantee invocation to preserve business relationships with the group whose other group companies may be giving good business to the bank. Also, it could be an old client. Besides, recovering a loan through a guarantee invocation can be timing consuming,\" said a senior banker.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a borrower refuses to repay post guarantee invocation, banks have to move the court or initiate proceedings at a Debts Recovery Tribunal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a timeline spelt out in a guarantee document would certainly put extra pressure on a company to behave as it knows the bank is bound to act. I feel putting an end to open-ended corporate guarantees is a step in the right direction,\" said another person. \"Traditionally, banks never set a timeframe when a guarantee would be invoked. We have to figure out how this would work,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 90% of the 50,000 debt ratings in the country are on bank loans. Banks prefer rating on loans as risk weightage on such assets comes down, letting lenders preserve some capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rating on a loan which has a corporate guarantee carries the tag \\'CE\\' (or, \\'credit enhancement\\'.) This improves the rating on the loan by at least one notch than it would have fetched without parent support. The RBI note relates to such loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nRBI also said that an arm of a foreign company in India cannot be given \\'CE\\' rating unless the overseas parent has a rating from one of the top three rating agencies in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, for non-loan debts, like non-convertible debentures or NCDs - a preferred borrowing route for several corporates - \\'CE\\' on a rating does not reflect explicit support from the parent. Instead, it simply indicates that some extra cushion, like cash collateral, is set aside by the borrower to give a degree of comfort to financial creditors subscribing to the NCDs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of securities which are \\'guaranteed\\', rating agencies use the nomenclature \\'SO\\' (or, structured obligation). But agencies add \\'SO\\' to only ratings of securitised papers, like pass-through certificates, which though similar to bonds are riskier instruments and whose servicing of interest and principal repayment depends on the cash flow generated by an underlying pool of loans. Thus, what \\'SO\\' is to a securitised paper, \\'CE\\' is to a bank loan. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"The guarantee structure for NCDs was streamlined by Sebi. Now RBI is doing it for bank loans which form the bulk of the ratings,\" said a source in the loan market.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuarantees cannot be invoked once lenders initiate action under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against a corporate borrower and their petition is accepted by the National Company Law Tribunal - a quasi-judicial authority set up to deal with corporate disputes. There is a standstill on payouts to creditors by the company concerned once IBC proceedings begin.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",
      " \"AgenciesMorgan Stanley India's Ridham Desai This is like a mid-bull market type of correction, said Morgan Stanley's head of India research Ridham Desai. In an interview with Sanam Mirchandani and Nishanth Vasudevan ahead of the firm's annual India conference, Desai said he is bullish on banks, consumer discretionary and technology. Edited excerpts:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow are you reading Indian market valuations after the recent fall?\\r\\nGiven that India is at the beginning of a potentially large and long growth cycle, I am quite okay with valuations. They are not extended or too cheap. At this point in the market cycle what matters is the growth cycle rather than valuations. We are at the mid-cycle stage; the early pickings are done when the valuation re-rates in anticipation of higher growth. The next stage is likely driven by growth rather than multiple expansion. This is like a mid-bull market type of correction. The global growth tailwind will not be as strong as it was in 2003-2007.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's valuations have always been at a premium. Are they justified given the macro headwinds?\\r\\nEmerging markets as a cohort are no longer the same as it was 20 years ago. Certain EMs are totally broken in macro terms. Comparing India with that cohort is becoming less and less relevant. I would want to look at this relative to India's own history. If you look at price to book, we are kind of on a par with history. Of course, the ROEs (return on equity) are below history. The market is anticipating a new ROE cycle. The ROE will probably get to around 20%, but I don't know whether we will get to 24%. Another thing is the GDP growth number. We averaged nearly 9% between 2003 and 2008. It is going to not go at that rate. The economy is very differently sized so it is unlikely to deliver the same type of real growth and that also impacts ROE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich investment themes are you betting on?\\r\\nThe banking space is our largest overweight position. In the next 12 to 18 months, banks could probably end up being the best performing sector. In banking, we have improving credit growth, falling credit costs and potentially rising NIMs (net interest margins) as rates go up. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing to watch out for is discretionary consumption. There's a revival in jobs and wages, and there is also pent-up demand coming out of the Covid lockdowns. Discretionary consumption looks very strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also like tech. The US recession is not our base case but if it happens, then there will be some cutback on spending, and that will hurt Indian tech companies. A lot of them have surprised us on the upside with their transition from enterprise to digital over the last five-seven years. We are underweight everything else including healthcare, energy, materials and utilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAre the IT stock valuations cheap after the recent sell-off?\\r\\nNo, they are not. Their growth profile has shifted so they ought to be trading better than history especially if you take a 10-year period. If you take a 25-year history, then it is okay because they had gone into bubble territory at the end of the 90s. The correction reflects the concerns that both the US markets and Indian tech stocks have expressed about a potential US recession or a material slowdown in growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003-2010 period belonged to infrastructure, 2010 to 2020 was consumption. Do you think this decade will belong to infrastructure again?\\r\\nI would almost go to the extent of saying the stars are aligned for a major revival in India's manufacturing sector. The sector has lost share in GDP persistently over the last 20-25 years. A lot of things have changed in the last few years. We have competitive tax rates and corporations are looking to diversify away from China on an incremental basis and looking to come to India to set up production facilities. The government is trying direct cash incentives to companies to invest in India. Manufacturing would be the thing to watch out for in the next ten years.\\r\\n\"\n",

      " \"ET SpotlightThe fact that Indians shy away from discussing retirement plans has a lot to do with our lack of financial literacy. Most of us have spent many precious minutes fantasizing about the day when we can retire and won't have to go to work. We dream about a happy retirement, imagining ourselves taking a break from all responsibilities. However, only a few of us will be able to live this ideal retirement life when the time eventually comes to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a certain age, we're all faced with the responsibility of looking after our aging parents but we fail to remember that the same fate awaits our children too when we meet our retirement age, unless we ensure adequate retirement planning ahead of time. For example, a stable retirement fund ensures that we're never financially vulnerable and can afford any care we require. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, experts believe there are three important reasons why retirement planning should be a priority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can't work forever. Many of us want to work post-retirement too. But will the meagre income be sustainable? Hence, retirement planning is essential to be financially independent after you stop working.\\r\\nThe future is uncertain, and you might have to make an unplanned large investment. But will it be possible to execute this if you can't work? Good savings and the right investment can help you through unprecedented times and challenges.\\r\\nHealth problems are unavoidable as time passes by. Medical expenses are bound to make a dent in your savings and leave you stranded financially post-recovery.\\r\\nIndia, like several other developed countries, lacks a social security system to care for the aged. There is neither free medical care nor a monthly government pay-out on which pensioners can rely. Even government employees who formerly had the security of a guaranteed pension must now build a corpus because the government has eliminated this benefit for most of its employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why are we not prioritizing retirement plans? How long can we postpone an ever-looming necessity? Beyond the age of 50, one barely has the time and money to plan a joyful retirement. If this rings a bell for you, here are some of the best tips from industry experts to plan your retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate alternate sources of income.\\r\\nKeep increasing the contribution to your retirement savings every year.\\r\\nDo not rely solely on security schemes.\\r\\n Keep risk factors in mind before investing a considerable sum of money.\\r\\nConsider inflation. Rs. 10 lakhs today will not have the same monetary value 20 years later.\\r\\nStay away from excessive expenditure.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\nIn an environment of rising inflation and market volatility, it's essential to have a retirement fund large enough to last you your lifetime. Otherwise, you risk being compelled to work during your retirement, a situation that no one wants to be in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, you can take a chance and trust that your children will take care of you, but that is a significant leap of faith to make.

      " 'ET SpotlightEquity markets have seen a sharp recovery from Covid-19 lows, and continuous investor inflows have pushed the industry assets under management (AUM)* well past the Rs. 38 lakh crore mark for the financial year-ended 31 March 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the AUM* for the equity segment, at Rs. 13.6 lakh crores, surpassed that of the debt segment at Rs. 12.9 lakh crore for the first time. By comparison, just two years ago, in March 2020, equity AUM* stood at just Rs. 7 lakh crore, while debt AUM was at Rs. 10.3 lakh crore. Since then, thereâ€™s been a continuous month-over-month increase in AUM*. Even when you consider the hybrid schemes or multi-asset schemes, the allocation for equity is much higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, Indian investors have always preferred investing in real estate, gold, and bank fixed deposits (FDs), but poor inflation-adjusted returns for these asset classes have led to a shift in investor preferences. Direct equity is still considered difficult by new investors, and most prefer to enter the markets via the mutual fund route. Between March 2020 and October 2021, benchmark equity indices had more than doubled, attracting many new investors to stock markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that domestic inflows have been steadily increasing even during such tumultuous times over the past two years is a sign of increased investor participation and growing share of household savings into mutual funds. We also find newer investors in recent graduates who have just started working, as well as among the many who have shifted to the work-from-home (WFH) model. They are tech-savvy and adapt easily to online investing. Covid-19 lockdowns and low-interest rates have encouraged investors to start investing in mutual funds. Job uncertainties have also taught us the importance of regular savings, and this discipline reflects in the monthly systematic investment plan (SIPs) inflows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the flows in equity funds have seen robust growth, inflows into debt funds have been poor due to below-par returns, compared to bank FDs. In 2020 and 2021, large-cap funds generated average returns of 15-25 percent*** while most of the shorter-end debt fund categories have given average returns of 3-5 percent*** in the same time frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased participation by retail investors has also led to greater awareness about the various funds offered by asset management companies (AMC). While seasoned investors may prefer to invest directly with the AMCs, new investors prefer to do it via mutual fund distributors (MFD). While direct plans have lesser expenses, regular plans offered by MFDs help newer clients build up portfolios, plan SIPs, and carry out non-financial transactions like KYC updates, address changes, etc with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven senior citizens who earlier relied on a fixed income like deposits and debt funds, are now keen to explore mutual funds which offer better risk-adjusted returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestors are also willing to stay invested for longer, even through periods of volatility. Earlier, retail investors would panic at the slightest dip. But now we see more investors ready to hold on through corrections of 10-15 percent**, with some even using it as an opportunity for lumpsum investments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the pandemic has slowly and steadily instilled a sense of financial discipline in the retail investor, thereby improving their preparedness for a rainy day. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSources:\\r\\n*AMFI AUM data from\\r\\n https://www.amfiindia.com\\r\\n** BSE, NSE indices data from \\r\\nhttps://bseindia.com and https://www.nesindia.com\\r\\n*** Fund returns data from\\r\\n https://www.valueresearchonline.com/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nViews are personal: The author - Adil Behram Driver, is the founder of trademark WAVES â€“ Wealth AVEnueS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: T\\r\\nhe views expressed are of the author and are personal.

      " 'ET SpotlightWhat if, in a football match, there are 22 players running after a ball but there are no goalposts? Doesnâ€™t make sense, does it? It doesnâ€™t.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when it comes to investments, most of us make this mistake. Most people do random savings and invest without financial goals. As the saying goes, â€œAn investment without a goal is like a traveller without a destination.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy goal-based investing?\\r\\nMoney can be a tool to accomplish greater goals in your life, such as giving your child the best education, pursuing your hobbies, travelling to the destinations youâ€™ve always wanted, buying your dream home, saving for your golden yearsâ€¦ the list goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouâ€™re closer to achieving your goals when your money goes into goal-based investments rather than random savings. Goal-based investing ensures that you save for each goal in advance, which makes it more likely for you to achieve them. Also, it helps you match your time horizon to your asset allocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore investing your money, you should know the 4Ks - Kya? Kab? Kitna? & Kaise?\\r\\n\\r\\nET Spotlight\\r\\nKya - what is the investment for?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKab - when would you require this money? If you know what your goal is and the time you have in hand, itâ€™s wiser to invest in equities that work best in the long-term, rather than investing in short-term assets and compromising the return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKitna - how much money would you require? You need to adjust the current cost with the inflation to arrive at the future cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKaise - how much do you need to invest? Investments can be done via SIPs or lump sums. Here, you also need to define your asset allocation, which will depend on your risk appetite. You can get your risk profile test done to arrive at the asset allocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are some of the behavioural and financial reasons why goal-based investment is a better way of investing:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Avoid under-saving: Goal-based investments make you think and enumerate your goals in advance. This prevents you from miscalculating how much money youâ€™ll need to invest for your financial goals. Instead of random savings, you will save the appropriate amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Plan ahead, save less, achieve more: Goal-based investing means lesser liabilities. Hereâ€™s how: when you start saving for a goal well ahead of time, you need to save less. Why? Because you will benefit from the power of compounding. The earlier you start saving, the more time there is for the investments to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you require a corpus of Rs. 100 lakhs for your childrenâ€™s higher education. You need to save just Rs. 17,000/month for 18 years if you start at the time he/she is born. But if you start 5 years later, you need to invest Rs. 31,000/month - 55% more every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturns are assumed at 10% per annum. (Investment amounts are for illustrative purposes only and does not assure any guaranteed returns.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Save for a tangible outcome: Think about the outcome of your investment. When you attach a real outcome to the purpose of your saving, youâ€™re more likely to work towards that goal. It also discourages you from withdrawing or redeeming the funds in between due to short-term market fluctuation and it keeps you on track.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Guilt-free spending: While some might find it surprising, there are people who feel guilty and are uncomfortable with spending large amounts of money. But when you spend money from an investment specifically earmarked for that purpose, you will spend it without guilt. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5) Achieve optimal returns: Goal-based investing matches your time horizon with your asset allocation, and you can allocate investments according to the time frame of the goal. A bike is best for going around the city, but to go to another country, you need to get on a flight. Similarly, different assets work differently in different time horizons. Goal-based investing ensures that you invest in the most suitable asset depending on your goals to ensure optimum returns. For example, if your goal is 12 years away, equities would be the best way to go. But if your goal is just a couple of years away, equities might not give you the desired results.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you arenâ€™t investing based on your goals, youâ€™re just running in a field with a ball, not knowing where to shoot. Start goal-based investing now and win the game!\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Goal-Based Investing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nViews are personal: The author - Abhishek Mohta, CFP & Founder, Trustedarms Wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer:\\r\\nThe views expressed are of the author and are personal.

And accelerating manufacturing costs suggest the worst is yet to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkets are starting to price in rising inflation expectations and more aggressive central bank action across much of Asia. Thatâ€™s beginning to mirror trends seen in the U.S., where data Tuesday showed consumer prices last month rose by the most since late 1981, piling fresh pressure on the Federal Reserve to respond.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegional government bond yields have risen through this year, led by South Korea, with the emerging Asia total return index down 2.6%, its worst performance since 2013. That signals an expectation that some central banks will raise interest rates to slow inflation and prop up their currencies as capital leaves the region.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turning point was Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered an upheaval in commodities markets. That pushed energy and fuel prices higher and threatened grain supplies to the worldâ€™s top consuming region. Rising fertilizer and transport costs are also filtering through to compound record global food prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nElevated commodities prices are seen fanning inflation in developing Asia by 1 full percentage point to 3.7% this year, the Asian Development Bank said earlier this month. While thatâ€™s relatively tame compared to rates in the U.S., itâ€™s forcing policymakers to shift focus and spooking some investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA net $22.3 billion in investments last month flowed out of emerging Asia, excluding China, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group -- marking the biggest sell-off since March 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia, the worldâ€™s second-most populous nation, is feeling the food and energy pinch.

Governor Shaktikanta Das last week cited a â€œtectonic shiftâ€\\x9d in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook since the end of February -- basically, Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine -- which â€œupended the earlier narrativeâ€\\x9d of calmer price pressures this year. \\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œIn the sequence of our priorities, we have now put inflation over growth,â€\\x9d Das said. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn China, producer prices gained 8.3% from a year earlier, down from 8.8% in February but still above the median estimate of an 8.1%. Consumer prices excluding fresh food in Japan, the Bank of Japanâ€™s benchmark, rose 0.6% in February from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years, driven up by energy costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral banks in South Korea and Singapore also meet this week, with economists split on prospects for another rate increase in Seoul while those in the city-state of Singapore are expected to tighten settings to combat imported inflation, especially energy. \\r\\n\\r\\nFood poses the biggest inflation risk to Asian central banks despite the region being a net exporter, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Rolling lockdowns in China to suppress Covid-19 are another potential source of inflation for logistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatâ€™s more, further consumer price hikes are likely as manufacturersâ€™ input costs continue to climb. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the correlation between factory prices and consumer costs is influenced by a range of factors, as some companies absorb the charges or as exchange rates soften the blow, analysts at ANZ and Nomura Holdings Inc. see more inflation coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe gap between PPI and CPI is currently exceptionally large,â€\\x9d said Krystal Tan, an economist at ANZ, referring to prices paid by producers and consumers. â€œThis suggests to me that there are significant price pressures in the pipeline that will flow into CPI eventually as producers start to pass through more of the higher input costs.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œAsia supply chain stress is set to worsen in the months ahead, adding to concern about global inflation.

So, while there will be hybrid, we expect most employees to come back and return to the offices,\" he said. \\r\\n\\r\\n TCS will not be impacted by inflationary impulses in the global markets, from where it derives maximum revenues, Chandrasekaran said, adding that there will not be any curb on technology spends as digital transformation is a reality. \\r\\n\\r\\n The Tata Group chairman further said inflation in the country will be range-bound and lower than the developed world. \\r\\n\\r\\n Chandrasekaran, who has also served the board of RBI in the past, said, \"...the Indian market is extremely well placed for growth and the inflation in India will be lower than the western countries and also with the regulators in India continuing to monitor this space, I am hoping that this (inflation) will be very range-bound.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n TCS continues its goal of having the operating profit margin between 26-28 per cent, but there are uncertainties due to volatilities, he said. \\r\\n\\r\\n Asked about the Rs 1,200-crore provision made for Epic Systems\\' trade secrets lawsuit, Chandrasekaran said he feels the money which has been set aside is \"adequate\". \\r\\n\\r\\n He said the company gets only 5 per cent of its revenues from the domestic market, and he does not see it hitting the double-digit mark for many years to come. \\r\\n\\r\\n Meanwhile, Chandrasekaran also said the Tata Group is very keen to invest more in northeast India, create more jobs and also increase its spends in the social sector.\\r\\n( Originally published on Jun 09, 2022 )In Video: \\r\\n                India becomes an important market amid slow global GDP growth and high inflation: N Chandra at TCS AG'\n",

They raise money from investors and list on stock exchanges. After this, they look for acquisition opportunities within 18 months. Usually, they buy an existing company and merge it into the SPAC. This benefits the company being acquired since it helps them list on stock exchanges without having to float a public share sale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The relaxation will enable companies to be set up as SPACs,\" said Moin Ladha, partner, Khaitan & Co. \"This coupled exit opportunity for dissenting shareholders of a SPAC is a welcome step towards facilitating these transactions,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposal comes as other regulators in the country are also working on special rules for SPACs.

      " \"AgenciesFirst phase of the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) for India started in August 2016 and the next in April 2021, which is due to run till March 2026. The inflation target was renewed with the CPI target kept at 4%, with the upper tolerance level at 6% and the lower tolerance at 2%. The 2016 notification indicated, among other things that, the key advantage around a target was that it would accommodate unanticipated short-term shocks even while nudging Inflation Expectations (IE) to the centre of the range to which monetary policy will return the economy over the medium term.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main role for monetary policy through a nominal anchor such as CPI is to deliver low and stable long run inflation and IE. Even as we have seen stable inflation since the start of FIT, IE continue to remain high and sticky. In this regard, it would be useful to look at the bi-monthly Household Inflation Expectations Survey published by the central bank. The key statistics here, include the 3 month and 1 year ahead median inflation expectations. Let's take a look at the data for 3 periods: May 2016 to March 2021 (first phase of FIT); April 2021 to March 2022 (second phase of FIT that concludes in March 2026); May 2016 to March 2022 (whole period till now where FIT has been implemented).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of the FIT, IE has remained above 7% persistently, which is 1% above the upper tolerance level of 6% and has been closer to the high single digits for both the 3 month and 1 year ahead IE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the whole period, while the minimum three month and one year ahead IE at 7.2 and 7.9 have been above the upper tolerance level of 6%, in the second phase of FIT the three month and one year ahead IE have been significantly higher than the upper tolerance level of 6%. It would be interesting to go to the root causes of such high IE in the backdrop of six years of a FIT regime. While food and fuel prices could be a proximate cause, could it be that past episodes, prior to FIT, of high and entrenched inflation has led to an element of IE stickiness. Could the trump card to escape this entrenched IE lie with increased productivity through fiscal policy, which can complement FIT? Clearly, the thrust by the government through capex could be beneficial and transformative in this regard. Even as productivity changes take time and are structural, near term cyclical dynamics call for restrictive monetary policy. The real rates are negative when adjusted for IE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been a considerable shift in inflation forecasts from 4.5% in the Feb policy (with risks characterised as broadly balanced) to 5.7% in the April policy. Given the structural up move in global commodity prices and supply chain effects, inflation in India could be in the region of 6% and above 6% for three successive quarters. A simple Taylor rule that captures inflation deviations from target; output gap and a real rate could provide some intuition to likely policy rate outcomes. \\r\\n\\r\\nRates could go above 6% based on policy or 7% based on an alternative forecast especially in the backdrop of CPI at 6.95% and WPI at 14.55%. It would be useful to hike rates soon rather than move from accommodative to neutral followed by policy action. In this regard the period October 2019 to February 2020 could be useful in that, policy moved to calibrated tightening in October 2019 which remained in February 2020 when rates were cut (and policy moved to neutral). The current environment calls for moves the other way around.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, since more liquidity is drained for 14 days which is characterised as the main operation it would be interesting to start thinking about a transition of the policy rate from overnight to a 14-day main operation rate in the backdrop of a tightening cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author is MD, global emerging markets, Deutsche Bank\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

LocalCircles will escalate the findings of this study to stakeholders in the government, it added.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices of cooking oils including sunflower, peanut oil and canola have risen 50-70% over pre-Covid levels, escalated by the ongoing geopolitical tension.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia imports about 85% of soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil, 90% of sunflower oil is imported from Russia and Ukraine, while Indonesia and Malaysia are major exporters of palm oil to India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report said the price surge in edible oils continues to upset householdsâ€™ budgets and consumption patterns. In December last year, the government reduced import duty on refined palm oil to 12.5% from 17.5% to rein in the prices of the commodity. But despite the average contribution of edibles oilsâ€™ inflation to overall food inflation declined to 1.3% from 3% in FY-21, prices of these commodities remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith prices of edible oil having risen steeply over the last 12 months, half the households said they are consuming the same amount as before and paying more each month from savings. The report flagged that the rise in prices of edible oils is forcing low and middle income households to opt for cheaper and low-quality oils, which could potentially lead to health risks.\\r\\n'\n",

In Haryana, intermittent pre-monsoon rains have helped farmers to sow paddy crop. Paddy farmers in Bengal, too, are sowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œAs of today, monsoon has been decent for sowing soyabean crop, though in Malwa region there is lesser rainfall which is impacting sowing,â€\\x9d said D N Pathak, executive director of Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA). â€œBut we have time till first week of July. If it rains in this fortnight, then sowing will pick up in the region too.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to government data, as on June 10, kharif crop has been sown in 79.62 lakh hectares of land. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn last kharif, India had produced 127.20 lakh tonnes of soyabean, according to the first advance estimates of agriculture ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nKharif cotton sowing for the season in Gujarat is likely to increase by at least 15% compared to the previous season amid a rush to sow the crop well ahead of its schedule, industry executives said. Farmers had got good prices for cotton in domestic and international markets last season.\\r\\n\\r\\nVijay Setia, a basmati rice producer from Haryana, said there has been intermittent pre-monsoon rains in the state for last three to four days, which has helped farmers to sow the basmati crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bengal, the largest producer of non-basmati rice in the country, farmers have started sowing in places that have received good rainfall. â€œThere have been good rains in last three days. Farmers of Bengal had started sowing and the rains have added further momentum,â€\\x9d said Subrata Mondol, general secretary of Burdwan District Rice Mills Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kharif 2021, India had produced 107.04 million tonnes of rice. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its forecast for next five days has said gradual maximum temperature is likely to rise by 2-4 degree centigrade over most parts of northwest India and Madhya Pradesh.

Investors should maintain neutral or equal weight asset allocation.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThere might be a further correction in the market if the events donâ€™t turn out as expected by the optimists.

Be a long-term investor and follow the â€˜dharmaâ€™ of asset allocation,â€\\x9d the veteran asset manager said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking about earnings, he said it is now dominated by commodities and cyclical companies. â€œCurrently, many companies are not able to pass the price rise to the consumers. For the June 2022 quarter, the topline will be higher due to inflationary pressures but margins will get squeezed. We maintain Rs 825-875 EPS for Nifty50 companies in FY23,â€\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The quality of earnings is changing. Earlier, earnings were dominated by IT, pharma, banking, and financial services but now it is dominated by commodities and cyclical companies like metals. You will have to not only look at the quality of earnings but also the quantum of earnings and with this uncertainty, it is a bit difficult to say which way it will go,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nShah also gave a few inspiring examples to motivate the young and new stock market investors on Dalal Street. \"I still vividly remember Anil Kumble wearing a plaster and balling to Brian Lara despite being hit by a fast bowler. He had a fracture in his jaw but he ended up taking the wicket of Brian Lara in the end. Something similar also happened with Sachin Tendulkar as well,\" Shah highlighted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Likewise, investors have to suffer losses in the markets as well. Bull and bear markets are part of the investment journey. Don\\'t worry about the temporary losses and continue investing,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market veteran also highlighted that India is trading at a significant premium to its peer group. \"We are probably twice more expensive than China, twice more expensive than Brazil, twice more expensive than South Africa and infinitely expensive to Russia as their markets have corrected. Our ESG ranking, governance standards, environmental and social consciousness is significantly better than our peer group. So we will trade at a premium but sustaining today\\'s premium over the emerging market looks a bit doubtful,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe further added that FII outflows are likely to continue and the near-term uncertainties are pushing people to take the profit out of India. However, Shah also believes that India is a \\r\\nâ€˜lambi race ka ghodaâ€™.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seasoned expert is bullish on sectors like largecap IT, industrial and engineering, banking and financial services. â€œHowever, we are avoiding stocks trading on expensive and very cheap valuations.

      " 'ANIMumbai: It is said that too much money chasing too few goods is inflationary. But that may be only partially true. Empirical results of a study by economists at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation in the presence of economic slack.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, implying that monetary accommodation during Covid-19 by the central bank needs to be reversed once the economy gets back to its normal path of growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known economist and Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman\\'s theory which guided monetary policy through the world in the second half of twentieth century said that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and it occurs when too much money chases too few goods. Excess money creation, or unrestrained expansion in the balance sheet size of a central bank, accordingly, has been cited as the prime driver of inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is changing since the turn of the twentieth century across the globe and the link between money supply and inflation is weakening - even in India. Empirical results suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation during an economic slack. When the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, said a research paper carried in the latest RBI bulletin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authors are Sitikantha Pattanaik, Binod B. Bhoi and Harendra Kumar Behera, from the Department of Economic and Policy Research. The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBI\\'s economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Empirical findings for India suggest that excess liquidity that does not lead to higher broad money growth is not inflationary,\" the authors said. \"Only a robust pick-up in demand that can absorb the surplus liquidity in the system could be inflationary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research assumes significance as central banks across the globe that were in quantitative easing mode post global financial crisis in 2008 and went on aggressively expanding their balance sheets are now going for quantitative tightening. Back home in India, the RBI is being criticised for falling behind the curve in its inflation fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authors say that higher money growth may counterbalance the contractionary impact of the velocity shock rather than pose risks to inflation. Also, Friedman\\'s theory is increasingly less likely to hold in the age of financial innovations, rising digital non-cash modes of payments for transactions and also in view of the emergence of FinTech for financial intermediation.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",

At present, he is Director (strategy) at Estee Advisors and head of investments at Gulaq, a part of Estee Group.Investing in the stock market is becoming luring for people. Many of us think of it as a tool to get quickly rich. What investors lack is discipline and patience to stay in the market for the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stay invested for a longer tenure, one needs to understand the right way of observing the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market is no easy play, as not everything you see may be correct and vice versa.\\r\\nETMarkets Smart Talk: Srikanth Subramanian decodes factors that could derail momentum on D-St\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct way to look at the market returns:\\r\\nWe usually look at average historical returns as a primary activity before investing. This way of finding better avenues to invest is not totally correct. It doesnâ€™t consider every factor about the returns, thus may give an incorrect picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking only at the average market returns at a particular point in time may give a biased result. You may end up having too high or too low expectations. Over a period of time, stock prices show volatility.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the ways to look at the market returns with accuracy is â€˜Rolling returnsâ€™. Rolling returns guide investors on the range of returns that are expected, showing the highest return, lowest return, and average return for a given time period.\\r\\n\\r\\nLetâ€™s understand the concept of Rolling returns by the following example.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the image below, if you consider the period of one year beginning from January 2016 to December 2016, the market gave a return of 12% in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, an investor started investing in February 2016, his return was 20% at the end of one year in January 2017. Someone lucky might have started investing in March 2016 and completed one year in February 2017 with a return of 25%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, these different one-year periods show the series of possible market returns in a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nLooking only at the average returns may prove to be misguiding for the investors. The whole picture may differ. For example, the Nifty 50 gave a 14% average market return for the last five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not give the whole picture of an investor who has 5 years investment horizon. Another noteworthy thing is the highest return for five years was 75% and the lowest return for the five years was 2%.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, the time period of above five years has the lowest return in a positive number. Therefore, it is evident that the larger the time frame, the higher the possibility of positive returns and a low risk of losing capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefining tenure can be a subjective term for investing, but one can follow this general definition to understand the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do Long-term investing and Short-term investing mean?\\r\\nGenerally, Long-term investing means staying invested in any financial asset for more than one year. On the other hand, short-term investing means staying invested in the same financial asset for a period of lesser than one year. Though, these definitions are only correct from a taxation perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual definitions of long term and short term may differ for all of us. For some, it may be just a year, but for others, the long term can be 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nLooking at the above chart, we can see that there are almost 100% chance of positive returns if one stays invested for at least 5 years. Hence when thinking about investing for long term, one should have minimum time horizon of 5 years, though more the better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Long-term investing is a better option?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Less time-consuming\\r\\nOne of the major benefits of investing for the long-term is you do not need to constantly monitor your investment. In short-term investing, you constantly need to monitor the price movements. This requires more time and huge effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, long-term investing gives you a hassle-free experience. Once you selected the fundamentally strong stocks, you can choose to stay relaxed. You just need to periodically check their performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Higher returns due to compounding\\r\\nCompounding, which was called the â€˜eighth wonder of the worldâ€™ by Albert Einstein, has phenomenal power. This element enters into the game of long-term investing if dividends and stock returns over time are reinvested. The larger the investment horizon, the higher the power of compounding and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose Harshit and Ronak, and Meet invest Rs. 5,00,000 on the same day in the same stock and earn the same interest of 10%. All of them decided to stay invested for 12 years. Harshit thought of withdrawing the interest every year, whereas Ronak and Meet chose to reinvest the interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarshit who chose to withdraw the interest every year would receive Rs. 11,00,000 at the end of 12 years. Whereas, Ronak and Meet would receive Rs. 15, 69,214 at the end of 12 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Meet wants to stay invested for further 3 years and wants to keep reinvesting the interest. At the end of his 15 years of investment, he would receive Rs. 20,88,624 even with the same rate of interest. This shows the real power of compounding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No burden of timing the market\\r\\nShort-term investing requires a trader to time the market. The practice of timing the market can make huge money, on the one hand, the investors may end up losing huge on the other due to wrong anticipation. Due to the fact that the â€˜Future is uncertainâ€™, predicting the market exactly is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a long-term investor, you can be free of the stress of predicting future price movements and taking entry and exit decisions frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Negligible impact of short-term fluctuations\\r\\nPrice fluctuation is inherently in the nature of the stock market. This tends to bring in human emotions, and investors may end up taking wrong decisions looking at such fluctuations. The recent Russia vs Ukraine crisis is one example. â€˜Volatilityâ€™, which is a big part of the picture of short-term investing, is a very small part of long-term investing. The large picture of long-term investing allows investors to avoid such short-term fluctuations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoints to take care of when invested for the long term\\r\\nFollowing are the points you should take care of while invested for the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€¢ Keeping yourself updated about the news is not bad but taking entry or exiting from funds on such short-term news can impact your long-term investment.\\r\\nâ€¢ Do not expect to get your return doubled in a very short span of a month or even a year.\\r\\nâ€¢ Do not think of beating the benchmarks, in terms of return, all the time. If you are investing with discipline and consistency, beating the benchmark would be of little account in the long term.\\r\\nâ€¢ Do not make any decision with emotional bias or intuition. Rely more on data than anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, long-term investing is a key to unlocking huge potential returns. Though long-term investing is the plant that you do not need to water daily but taking care of it periodically is important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The slope of the yield curve steepened with the onset of pandemic-related policy easing, reversing after the recent policy tightening phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe researchers found that the declining level of the yield curve pointed to a contraction even before the data release in 2020-21.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The yield curve is indicating an improvement in long-term growth prospects and an upshift in ex-ante inflation expectations. At the same time, the fact that the yield curve has become steeper and concave reconfirms expectations of tighter monetary policy in the period ahead,\" the researchers said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results of the research are that of the authors from the RBI\\'s economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself, which the central bank has always maintained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government securities yield curve is widely regarded as a valuable predictor of future macroeconomic developments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research showed that in contrast to advanced economies, it is the level and curvature of the yield curve rather than its slope that contain useful information on market expectations about economic prospects and inflation expectations in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The results from a yield-macro model indicate that the level and curvature of the yield curve have more information content on future macroeconomic outcomes than the slope. This finding contrasts with the received wisdom and the experience of other countries,\" the paper said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt found that the level of the yield curve has increased since 2021 after a steep decline during the pandemic. Furthermore, the yield curve is concave compared to 2019 levels, indicative of strengthening prospects for the recovery, higher inflation expectations and hence market expectations of front-loaded monetary policy normalisation.'\n",

The markets saw a weak opening following mildly negative global cues.After two days of consolidation, the equity markets finally resumed their up move as it not only prepared some ground to resume its up move but also ended the day on a positive note. The markets saw a weak opening following mildly negative global cues. However, the Nifty opened on a much resilient note and marked the day's low point in the opening minutes of the session.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe index inched higher and recouped all its opening losses by late afternoon trade. It stayed in an upward trajectory throughout the day and kept marking incremental high points. Though it stayed sideways during the last half hour of the session, but largely maintained the gains. The headline index closed with a net gain of 105.25 points (+0.64%).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nETMarkets Smart Talk: Indiaâ€™s investable landscape wider than other EMs despite premium valuations: Piyush SharmaIt was the weekly options expiry, and it went well on the expected lines. The markets picked up steam the moment it was above 16,500. This level continued to see high put wiring activity during the day. Moving on from here, the Nifty is near the upper edge of the consolidation and any move above 16,700 will propel the markets higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as the Nifty is below 16700, it will stay in the broad 16,400-16,700 congestion zone and would trade with positive bias but will refrain from taking any sustainable directional bias. Friday is likely to see a stable start; the levels of 16,700 and 16,765 will act as immediate resistance points. The supports come in at 16,550 and 16,480 levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 53.31. It shows a mild bullish divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bullish and remains above the signal line. A bullish engulfing candle emerged on the charts; it may act as a potential onset of resumption of the up move for the index, subject to confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern analysis shows that the Nifty got a breakaway gap above 16400. However, after that it consolidated in a narrow zone and saw a classical throwback. It tested the levels from where it had broken out and it has tried to resume to up move. It has resistance near 16700; any move above that will propel the markets higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, the analysis remains on similar lines. If the markets have some mild profit taking or remain weak if weak global cues affect them, it is strongly recommended to refrain from creating fresh shorts. All dips, if any, must be used to make select purchases. While continuing to adopt a selective approach in the markets, profits too must be protected at higher levels unless the level of 16,700 is taken out comprehensively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, is a Consulting Technical Analyst and founder of EquityResearch.asia and ChartWizard.ae (ChartWizard, FZE) and is based at Vadodara.

      " 'AgenciesAnalysts estimates show Tata Motors CV business is likely to show 11-27 per cent year-on-year (YoY) sales growth, the most among its competitors.Commercial vehicle (CV) sales may stay on the uptrend while some improvement in sales is likely in the personal vehicle (PV) segment, analysts said ahead of June sales data. Two-wheelers numbers may be weak on a month-on-month (MoM) basis post-marriage season demand in May, they said. Tractors sales may improve MoM but would be weak YoY due to delayed monsoon, analysts added. \\r\\n\\r\\nMotilal Oswal said it prefers companies with higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, margin drivers, and balance sheet strength. Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland are its top auto picks. It also likes Tata Motors as a play on the global PV cycle. In the ancillary space, it prefers Bharat Forge and Apollo Tyres.\\r\\n\\r\\nNomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) due to strong model cycle tailwinds. It also likes Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Rising electrification and content per vehicle will be the key value drivers for suppliers, the brokerage added, as it prefers Sona Comstar, Minda Industries and Sansera in the ancillary space.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmkay likes Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Escorts in the auto space and Motherson Sumi and Minda Industries in the ancillary space.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoice Broking, meanwhile, has an \\'Outperform\\' rating on Ashok Leyland and an \\'Add\\' rating on a handful of stocks such as M&M, Maruti, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor.\\r\\nChannel checks, said Choice Broking, suggests sales momentum for PV, CV, and tractor segments may continue to be healthy YoY despite the industry entering into the off-season cycle i.e. July-August. The brokerage expects two-wheeler sales to be weak due to higher vehicle and fuel costs, cooling-off of marriage-related purchases, and weak sentiment in the lower-income bracket.\\r\\n\\r\\nNomura India said healthy demand trends sustained for both medium-heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) and PV in June, as it expects PV wholesales to benefit from improving chip supplies, with June volumes likely at 3,17,000 units, being the â€˜all-time best Juneâ€™ wholesales. The brokerage expects a further improvement in July.\\r\\nFor two-wheelers, retail sales have dropped 8-10 per cent MoM post-marriage season demand in May, Nomura said, as it estimates industry retails in June to be below the June 15 levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While easing semiconductor supplies boost PV retail figures, CV demand momentum is sustaining. We prefer 4Ws over 2Ws underpinned by strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We expect the CV cycle to maintain its momentum,\" Motilal said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotilal said a delayed monsoon has led to the postponement of demand for tractors. Agricultural demand is subdued currently, and commercial demand remains flat. Inventory in the system is around 30 days, it said. On a year-on-year basis, this brokerage expects tractor volumes to decline 3 per cent for M&M and 2 per cent for Escorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a MoM basis, however, Emkay sees tractor volumes improving MoM, with the growth of 11 per cent for Escorts and 10 per cent for M&M in the domestic market. Growth has been restricted as farmer sentiments have been hit by lower crop realisations in recent months, Emkay noted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgencies\\r\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

      " 'On a weekly options expiry day, the Indian equities had a strong trending day as they opened strong, got better as the day progressed and ended the day on a strong note. The Nifty saw itself opening comfortably above the crucial 200-DMA. It maintained its gains in the morning session. As the day progressed, the markets got even stronger. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe index, in the process, kept marking gradual incremental highs and managed to close near the high point of the day. There was no sign of profit-taking at any point in time. The headline index closed with a net gain of 256.05 points (+1.49%).\\r\\n\\r\\nETMarkets.com\\r\\nThe weekly options expiry took place today. In the previous note, it was mentioned that the level of 17,200 had the second-highest call OI accumulation. Since the markets opened well above that, they trended strongly towards the 17,400 levels. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest call writing was witnessed at this point and prevented the Nifty to stay a notch below this level. Importantly, the index has managed to hold on to the 200-DMA as its crucial support on a closing basis. The 200-DMA stays at 17,185. The monthly options expiry data shows that the upsides may get capped near 17,500, which holds the maximum Call OI accumulation as of now.\\r\\n\\r\\n However, this is very indicative -- if the up move gets extended, then the price action of Nifty against the level of 17,500 will be crucial to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday is likely to see a quiet start to the day. The levels of 17,440 and 17,500 will act as probable resistance points. The supports come in at 17,280 and 17,185 levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daily RSI is 5,135; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bearish and stays below the signal line. A rising window emerged on the candle -- this usually resolves in the direction of the trend. The pattern analysis shows that after a brief violation of the 200-DMA, the Nifty managed to crawl back above this point. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 200-DMA stands at 17,185 and is likely to remain a crucial support point for the index in the near term on a closing basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, the defensive play in the markets was evident. In the coming session as well, we will continue to see pockets like PSE stocks, FMCG, Consumption, IT, and Pharma doing relatively well than the rest of the population. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe recommend continuing to stay selective and keep leveraged exposures on a modest level. Until and unless the levels of 17,500 are not taken out comprehensively, vigilant protection of profits is advised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, is a Consulting Technical Analyst and founder of EquityResearch.asia and ChartWizard.ae (ChartWizard, FZE) and is based at Vadodara.

But, the bias is in favour of more downside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recommend investors avoid buying at this level and sell on rise around Rs 235-240 odd level for a downside target of Rs 200 - 180 in the next 3-4 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdani Enterprises: BuyFrom lows of Rs 121 in March 2020, the stock has given a sharp upside rally to make an all-time high of Rs 1,908 in January 2022. Volumes were quite high during this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a high of Rs 1,908, the price corrected to take support at 50-WMA at Rs 1,525 and gave a sharp upside rally to make a new all-time high of Rs 2,421-odd level.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, after moving in the range of mere 300 points for the past 2 months, with relatively higher volume, the price has now breached the range on the higher side and from here we can see the stock making a new high.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice is also moving above major averages which is a good sign for a bull run.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, we recommend investors to buy at this level and more on dips towards Rs 1,900 with a stop loss of Rs 1,700 on a closing basis. On the upside, we can see levels of Rs 2,600-3,000 odd levels in the next 8-10 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdani Wilmar: BuyAt the time of listing, the stock opened below the offer price to make a low of Rs 227 and from there we saw a sharp upside rally of 190 points in that particular week.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 12 Feb 2022 to 25 Mar 2022, the price moved in a consolidation phase and once it breached the range on the higher side, the price gave an upward move to make an all-time high of Rs 878-odd levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a high of Rs 878, the price retraced almost 52% of the previous rally to make a low around Rs 540 and currently, it is moving at Rs 615-odd level.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can see further upside till Rs 850-1000 levels. At the current level, we can see positive divergence and once it goes above 50-DMA of Rs 660, a sharp upward move can be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, we recommend buying at this level and more at dips of Rs 540 with a stop loss of Rs 470 on a closing basis for a target of Rs 900-1,100 in the next 6-8 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The road to hell, in contrast, is well sign-posted and well travelled. The ways to win are many and unpredictable, but the ways to lose are fewer and entirely predictable. Whichever ladder you climb, you will need to steer clear of the same snakes,\" he wrote in his book \\r\\nSelecting shares that perform.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Koch is a former management consultant, entrepreneur, and a renowned author. Koch has also used his investment strategy to make a fortune from several private equity investments made personally. Previously, he had been a manager at Boston Consulting Group and later a partner at Bain and Company, before leaving to start management consulting firm LEK Consulting with Jim Lawrence and Iain Evans. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe was educated at the universities of Pennsylvania and Oxford. Koch is the author of more than 20 books, including the bestsellers \\r\\nThe 80/20 Principle and \\r\\nThe Financial Times Guide to Selecting shares that perform. He is also a successful investor and entrepreneur, with ventures including Filofax, Belgo, Plymouth Gin and Betfair. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRules to stop losing the investment battleWith his years of experience in the investment industry Koch wrote certain guidelines in his book to help avoid the unnecessary mistakes made by investors. Let\\'s take a look at some of these investment guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever invest funds you donâ€™t ownKoch says even if investors are able to, they should not borrow money to make equity investments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"However wealthy you are, donâ€™t do it. It has ruined millionaires and billionaires. Donâ€™t let it ruin you. The only thing to invest is money that you own which is not needed for any other purpose. There must be no exceptions to this rule,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose short-term investments with great cautionKoch says if investors decide to invest for a relatively short period which means two years or less there should be a valid reason for doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reason you have this time horizon is because you then want to use the money for something else: school fees, going round the world, a house deposit, or whatever. It would be annoying not to have your starting capital when that time comes,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the long-term record of shares is excellent but there is always a risk of a big fall over a short period and there is little protection in picking the most large, stable and â€˜safeâ€™ share, because if there is a general market decline, then blue chips will fall in line with the market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the whole, the stock market is not a good place for short-term, â€˜hotâ€™ money,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not over-diversify your portfolioKoch says investors should not over diversify their portfolio and never hold too many stocks as holding more than about 15 stocks does little to decrease risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, investors should know the companies they invest in extraordinarily well, which is very difficult if they invest in a large number of companies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is better to know a few things rather well, or one thing very well, than it is to know something about a lot of things,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says another reason for investing in fewer stocks is that inevitably investors will pause longer, think harder and weigh the buy or sell decision more carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will also be more vigilant in keeping an eye on them and will stand a much less chance of missing any necessity to sell, lighten or increase your holding. But how many is too many? It depends partly, but only partly, on the amount of time you have for your investments,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly invest if you are confidentKoch says before investing it is best to be confident about the medium and long-term prospects for the company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should not invest because you consider the shares â€˜a strong betâ€™. You must first look at the company and assess, by numbers or otherwise, whether it has a good future of growth ahead of it (one good way to assess this is to look at its past). Then you must consider whether the shares are fairly priced, undervalued or overvalued. One of the advantages of having a small portfolio of five to ten stocks is that you will not be tempted to include a few â€˜speculative long shotsâ€™,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever buy on tipsKoch says investors are probably approached from time to time by friends or acquaintances offering them â€˜hot tipsâ€™ based on rumours, or information close to the â€˜insideâ€™ but they should never, ever, buy shares as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For one thing, it just may be inside information, in which case you and your informant may be committing a criminal offence. But even if the use of insider information was made compulsory it is just not a sensible thing to do. You canâ€™t check the veracity or the importance of the data. In some cases, there may be a deliberate attempt to â€˜rampâ€™ the shares by those who have already bought and plan to sell soon. Tips belong on the race course, and even there they are usually wrong. Avoid them!,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not follow the crowdKoch says investors should resist the lure of going with a fad as investors could probably beat the majority of investors only by following a different path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stick to your investment strategy for the period you have set and do not be put off by analysts or be seduced by recommendations. You must still convince yourself, of course, that you are right, but, unless you have important new information since you made your original decision, do not be moved,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever â€˜average downâ€™ when the price is fallingKoch says averaging down is an unsound principle which means adding to holding of a stock, investors already have at a lower price than they previously paid for it, to lower the average acquisition price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The price at which you first bought a stock is irrelevant to whether you should buy or sell now. The only issue is whether, with the information you now have, the company has a good future and the shares are undervalued. Only this should impel you to buy, or indeed to hold, a stock: if you cannot confidently say â€˜yesâ€™ to the two points above, then sell,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch has the following advice for investors if they are planning to average down -\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Only average down with extreme caution, and after much deliberation.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Do not do it more than once a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Only do it if you are sure the companyâ€™s future is good and the shares are undervalued.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Do not allow one stock to take up more than a quarter of the value of your portfolio (this is an absolute maximum, not a target).\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Never average down more than once for the same stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Never average down until the price has been stable or rising, with at least one dayâ€™s rise, for the previous three days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever be afraid to sell at a lossKoch says some experts believe that investors should always discard the loss makers once they have fallen a predetermined amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If a share has fallen relative to the market as a whole (an important qualification), the onus is on you to say why you should keep it. You must have a good reason for doing so,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn from your experienceKoch says investors personal experience of investment, if analysed carefully, probably will show recurrent patterns of behaviour. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you divide your historic portfolio â€“ that is, all the shares you have owned â€“ into three categories, organised by the success or otherwise of the investments, itâ€™s likely that you will gain a lot of insight by asking what is common about all or some of the investments in each category. The aim is for you to categorise your investments as winners, losers and average (in all cases relative to the market), then to look at the winners and find a few common themes about them, either in terms of the types of company, how closely you know them, why you bought them, or any other common factors. Then repeat the process for the other two categories,\" he says. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not invest heavily when everyone else is doing the sameKoch says investors should not commit a lot of funds to the market when it is reasonably possible that the market is hitting a cyclical high.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, one way to avoid this is never to invest when the market is within 3 percent of a record high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBalance patience and prudenceKoch says there are two opposite schools of thought and approaches that investors can undertake while making an investment decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch one is the â€˜long-termistâ€™ approach which holds that there are almost no circumstances in which investors should sell shares in a â€˜goodâ€™ company. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this approach, the trick is to find a few such companies for the long term as an investor and then just stick with them. \\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the opposite philosophy is that markets are volatile and no one ever went broke by taking a profit. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which you prefer depends on how skilled you are likely to be at identifying even a few good companies. Not many people are good at doing this although, with the right training and encouragement to keep their eyes open, many more could be,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the best general position, though, may be three-quarters towards the â€˜long termâ€™ view.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch lists some guidelines that may help investors make better investment decisions -\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Do not be too patient with your under-performers.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Decide in advance if you have a target selling price above your cost price.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Even if the share reaches the target price, continue to hold (nervously) until the shares run out of steam.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If you can afford to, do not set a target price and continue to hold your winners for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. If your shares double in value in a short time, and you are thinking of selling, sell only half (or, if you have to, three-quarters) and lock the rest away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, beating the market is both possible and fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you fail: cut your losses. Hand your money management over to others and enjoy the rest of life. If you succeed, do something worthwhile with at least some of your wealth,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: This article is based on Richard Koch\\'s book The Financial Times Guide to Selecting shares that perform.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT'\n",
      " 'representative imageConsumer product companies expect a recovery in demand and profitability during the second half of the financial year due to good monsoon, elevated farm prices, fading inflationary pressures in the coming months, and the \\'low base\\' effect, even as they face slowing demand in the current quarter. Electronics makers, however, said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment, and demand for entry-level products will remain under pressure over next few quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Given the forecast for a normal monsoon this year coupled with a good harvest and farmers getting better prices for their crop, I am hopeful of a faster rural recovery. While there is an immediate pressure, we expect rural demand to recover by end-June this year,\" said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at Dabur India.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Jan-March quarter earnings performance, most companies blamed slowdown in the rural market for dragging the overall growth. However, expectations of a normal monsoon and elevated food prices have brightened the outlook for rural income in rabi and kharif season for FY23. In addition, non-agri wage growth has started to improve, up 4.2% in the second half of last fiscal after declining 0.5% in early FY22.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolume, or unit sales, of daily consumer products people bought fell 4.1% year on year during the March quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecline Sharper in Rural Areas \\r\\n During the quarter, shoppers cut back on household spending due to inflation and the Omicron wave dented sales, industry officials said, quoting Nielsen data. This was the second consecutive quarterly decline in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market after a 2.6% volume decline in the December quarter. The decline was sharper in rural areas that saw volume growth shrink by 5.3% during the March quarter while urban markets fell by 3.2%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarico Ltd managing director Saugata Gupta said FMCG market growth constituted a challenge in the near term due to high inflation and high base, but demand and volume growth should improve towards the end of the September quarter. \"This would be driven by the significant steps the government is taking to control inflation and lower base of the previous year. Even rural demand should improve in the next four to five months with projections of a normal monsoon and stability in inflation,\" said Gupta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government took a series of measures in order to cool inflationary pressures including reduced central excise duty on fuel, provide subsidy on gas cylinders and increased fertiliser subsidy. \"These interventions are likely to reduce inflation directly by 25 basis points, while indirect benefit can be another 25 bps. We expect inflation to average at 6-6.3% in FY23,\" said a recent report by Antique Broking. The lifting of a ban on palm oil export by Indonesia from Monday will aid margins too, which in turn, could slow down price increases that the companies have been making since several months.\\r\\n\\r\\n Emami Ltd vice chairman Mohan Goenka said while overall FMCG demand has been subdued, the summer products portfolio has registered double-digit growth for the first time in three years. \"Inflation is impacting the recovery, but we expect a recovery within the next two quarters. The government has already taken steps to control inflation and markets are wide open. If more stimulus is given by the government and there is normal monsoon, the recovery could be even earlier, including rural markets,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies, however, said a bulk of their growth could still be driven by price increases and not by greater unit sales, especially in discretionary categories. \"Consumers are getting impacted by inflation in almost everything they buy and consume. This will lead to conservation in the form of controlled consumption or downtrading in the next two quarters. While the impact on essentials will be marginal, other purchases may get postponed,\" said Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia Industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nGodrej Consumer Products said it anticipates a double-digit top line growth with low-single digit volume growth. \"Bottom line is hard to predict, but if the cost moderated to Malaysian ringgit 6,000 for palm oil, about 7% to 8% lower than where they are today and $100 for crude, we should see some margin expansion especially in the second half of the year,\" Sudhir Sitapati, managing director at Godrej Consumer Products, said during its earnings investor call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer Electronics\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consumer electronics industry had forecast a recovery of mass segment products and a revival in rural markets in the second half of this fiscal, but price increases of raw materials and consequentially final products will delay the recovery, industry executives said. Around 50-55% of the input cost are imported hence the industry expects prices will continue to go up by 5-6% every quarter. Prices have gone up by 10-12% already including the latest increase this month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Consumers of entry-level products are withholding discretionary purchases and buying electronic products only when there is a necessity. So the boom in AC and refrigerator purchases due to the heat wave may die down due to product price increases and overall inflationary environment,\" said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",

New Delhi: The ban on export of palm oil from Indonesia will hit India the hardest, which is the largest import of vegetable oils in the world. Even a number of stocks will feel the heat in vegetable oil prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rising inflation has been a major problem for FMCG, consumer and QSR sectors, which have been hiking the prices to absorb the impact. But another price hike might be a major challenge for the companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalm oil is the world\\'s most widely used vegetable oil as it accounts for about 40 per cent of the supply of top four edible oils. Global palm oil production slumped in 2020 and 2021 due to a drop in migrant labour on plantations across Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Palm oil is the relatively cheaper oil amongst the other edible oils. This move is expected to cause a further price increase in other edible oils such as soybean oil, sunflower oil,\" said Prabhudas Lilladher in its report.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarket experts believe that shortage of edible oils will impact the FMCG segments like biscuits, cake, soaps, and shampoos where it is a significant input. The FMCG industry may experience margin compression due to the price hike.\\r\\n\\r\\nVK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that HUL, Godrej Consumer, ITC and Britannia are likely to be impacted by the rising costs of inputs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe companies might be able to pass on the major part of higher cost to the consumers, but full burden shift may dent the volumes, he added. \"The FMCG sector is already struggling due to rising cost of packaging, thanks to the boil in crude oil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the biggest importer, India is highly dependent on Asian nations like Indonesia and Malaysia to fulfil its demand of 8 million tonnes of palm oil per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ukraine war has led to a large supply deficit of cooking oil across the globe, leading to prices of palm and soy oils to record highs. The export ban and increase in Malaysian taxes will further exacerbate the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nEchoing the similar views, Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that this turmoil will negatively affect FMCG companies like HUL, Nestle, Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products, Marico among others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The high prices will leave packaged food products manufacturers, soap manufacturers, and other personal care manufacturers with no other option than to raise prices and thus affecting their volumes,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a step ahead, Prabhudas Lilladher said that palm oil is a key ingredient in the major food processing industry and QSRs, impacting their cost and margins.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe the impact would be seen most in categories such as biscuits, noodles, cakes, potato chips, frozen desserts,\" it added. \"QSRs like Westlife Development and Burger King can also feel the pinch given edible oil usage to cook/fry their patties/fries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe financial firm has a buy rating on the QSR firms like Westlife Development and Restaurant Brands Asia.

      " 'AgenciesThe microfinance arm of the Muthoot Pappachan Group plans to revise rates from Monday.Kolkata: Borrowing costs for bottom-of-the-pyramid customers have begun to climb as the regulator removed the margin cap on NBFC-MFIs. Certain lenders have revised their lending rates upward by as much as 350 basis points as they apply risk-based pricing to arrest the asset quality degradation and the loss they suffered in the last three years. Several others are expected to follow suit, industry captains said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the deregulation of interest rates, we can now price for credit risk. So, a new-to-credit customer would pay slightly higher rates. But they can enjoy the benefit of lower rates after a few credit cycles if they show good credit behaviour and repayment record,\" Arohan Financial Services managing director Manoj Kumar Nambiar told ET.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least half-a-dozen MFIs including Arohan have revised their lending rates upward in the first week of April. They have fixed their rates 100-350 basis points higher at 23-24% per annum, excluding processing fees, industry sources said. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please do remember that effective median rates of deregulated entities (read: universal banks, small finance banks and non-banking finance companies) was around 24% before the uniform regulations on microfinance,\" Nambiar said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise in incremental costs of borrowing for NBCF-MFIs is another reason behind the abrupt change in lending rates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardening of market interest rates is the real reason. Bond yields have risen to 7%,\" said Sadaf Sayeed, chief executive of Muthoot Microfin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe microfinance arm of the Muthoot Pappachan Group plans to revise rates from Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sharper rise in lending rates is likely for new customers with no credit history as risk-based pricing will be introduced given the fact that every lender suffered huge losses during the last three years, the chief executive of a north India-focused MFI said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit bureau CRIF High Mark recently flagged that about â‚¹24,500 crore - which is 9.3% of the total microfinance portfolio of â‚¹2.64 lakh crore - remained unpaid even after 180 days of the due date, driving credit costs high for all microfinance lenders including NBFC-MFIs, impacting their profit numbers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"There may be temporary upward movement but gradually it will come down. Interest rates will reduce with good credit behaviour and repayment track record,\" said Satya MicroCapital managing director Vivek Tiwari.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier, in a regulated rate regime when interest rates charged by MFIs to borrowers were fixed based on a maximum 10% margin over costs of funds, the average rate of interest had come down to 20.83% during the third quarter of FY22 from 23.66% during the second quarter of FY21, according to sources.

But trends do change over time and chances are high that many retail investors who are invested in the popular \\'trend\\' may get trapped and find it difficult to shift to a new one, when that happens, leading to collateral damage. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a video posted on his YouTube channel ithoughtwealth, Sekhar said information in the past was limited and it was only through newspapers. Analysis was even lesser. The popularising of trend, he said, occurred under Harshad Mehta, who popularised the replacement cost theory and within no time everybody was calculating the replacement cost of everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat trend, he said, became so popular that it led to a bull market. Sekhar said his father, who was not usually interested in such trends, actually once asked him why he is not following the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, it reached people who were otherwise focused on their business activity.\\r\\nMORE STORIES FOR YOUâœ•This Mohammed Rafi song makes Shankar Sharma think of today\\'s marketWill the recent strength in retail flows into the stock market continue?ETMarkets Basics: All about PE ratio; 5 things to consider before making investment decisionÂ« Back to recommendation storiesI don\\'t want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT\\r\\n\"It had reached people who were traders, people who were from other walks of life. So, the trend as a concept was created only to do this: bring in people who are not in the stock market, into the stock market, and make them very keenly interested in the trend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is so that whatever such investors do in the stock market will be within this trend. All the money will travel into the trend. Now, this is something which I found very scary,\" Sekhar added.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said when he entered the stock market, he wanted his investing to be insulated from such trends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted to do it in a place where valuation was justified and where the long-term potential would eventually protect my capital and grow it. But most people found the popular trend to be simple and straightforward. But, look what happened in Harshad Mehta time in 1994, also during the GDR boom; and in 2000 when we had dot com bust; it happened in 2008 when we had the infra boom and it also happened in 2018 in the smallcap boom. It is happening now again when we are having the micro-investing boom,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said thematic investing, which people like him used to escape from, is becoming a trend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a very difficult place to be because what you thought was an approach, which will keep you away from mistakes, is now the mistake because people are popularising a theme into a trend so that they can bring in more people. You also have this theme manifesting in different ways. You have multiple information sources for this. The popularising is happening through Telegram, WhatsApp and YouTube. It\\'s also happening through webinars,\" Sekhar said adding that is why stocks are getting re-rated so fast these days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I look at the bare mechanics of all this, how it all works, I see no difference between what operators like Harshad Mehta did in the early 90s. And then it happened again in 2002, during Ketan Parekh time. And again, during 2008 during the infra boom,\" he said. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So many chemical stocks, which I see today at peaks, can very well be in a very different place after 24 months. But the way it is told to you, the way you are fed with information and perspective, is such that there is only one side. There is no other side. This one-sided flow of information is the basic fuel to create a popular trend into which you can suck a million people. Regulation cannot do much,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said investors need to protect themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Decide whether you want to buy options into cocaine or you want to buy a Satvik pill,\" he said. \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail investors should not get trapped and that is what regulators and everybody wants, he said adding that when collateral damage happens, the weakest ones get hit the most. \"This has happened in all cycles and it\\'s going to happen again,\" he warned.\\r\\n'\n",

Specialty CDMO clocked sales of a good Rs1.3bn (up 30% q/q); formulation sales were Rs184m (up 28% q/q). The gross margin was steady at 69-70%. Staff costs and other expenses were higher (more transportation and distribution costs) at respectively 8.6% (avg. 6-6.5%) and 17.4% of sales (vs. avg. 14-15%). This translated to a 43% EBITDA margin. The higher tax rate (43% vs avg. 25-33%) eroded profit, which was Rs917m (42% y/y, adj. for the share of profit from rising pharma). The brokerage slightly trims earnings estimate, factoring in higher formulations sales (boosted from Casperâ€™s site) which would drag on margins.

Higher interest rates in the US and a consequently stronger dollar diminish the appeal of assets in riskier emerging markets such as India.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.

Apart from this, geo-political issues in Europe and China region have to be closely monitored. If recessionary conditions start cropping up in the developed economies, then emerging economies will suffer a fallout from this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoop Bhootra, CEO - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers\\r\\nInflation, geopolitical uncertainties and fear of recession especially in developed markets are biggest concerns for the market in near term. Market has seen a major part of correction and valuations have also come down, and now major indices are trading at attractive levels. Hence, most of the fall is behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities\\r\\nWe believe that there is definitely room for correction.

The biggest concern being the hike in interest rate, escalation of geopolitical issues and increase in crude oil prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSiddarth Bhamre, Religare Broking\\r\\nWe believe most of the recent concerns for equities globally have emerged from the Russia-Ukraine war. If war led supply bottlenecks remain then we may see this fight with inflation stretching leading to further correction in valuations. Less than normal monsoon may break the back of rural demand which has been anyway marred by high inflation. Lastly, financial shocks which may emerge due to fall in asset prices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPunit Patni, Equity Research Analyst, Swastika Investmart\\r\\nThe biggest concerns for the market going ahead would be higher than expected inflation, intense rate hikes by central banks leading to a hard landing, and slow down of economic growth. Most of the negativity is already factored in and therefore levels are attractive. However, further 5-10% fall canâ€™t be ruled out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShiv Chanani, Head of Research, Elara Securities India\\r\\nContinued geo-political uncertainty remains the biggest risk for the market as it would entail sustained higher energy prices and hence elevated inflationary pressures. Secondly, risk would emanate from significant economic slowdown, particularly in markets like the US which could impact export demand.

With the surge in global commodity prices following the Ukraine war having significantly increased upside risks to Indiaâ€™s inflation, markets were bracing for tighter monetary policy but few were expecting the shift to a higher interest rate regime so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nJM Financial Institutional Securitiesâ€™ MD & Chief Strategist Dhananjay Sinha suggests a few key themes for portfolio management.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œWe have been guarding against rate sensitive, cyclical sectors such as banks, capital goods, industrials, etc. as they will be impacted by slower growth; we maintain that view. We have also been consistent in highlighting the valuation risks in small and mid-caps segments,â€\\x9d Sinha said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œWe continue to favour a balanced portfolio with higher weights on domestic non-cyclicals and other defensive components such as pharma, technology, utilities, etc.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher interest rates translate into higher cost of capital for firms as loans get dearer.

The data set was updated until March 29 of FY22.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While consumer sentiment and demand are likely to improve this year, the uncertainty over Russia-Ukraine geopolitics and US Fed policy could play the spoilsport,\" said K Ravichandran, chief rating officer at ICRA Ratings. \"With credit growth picking up, you can expect capex from renewable energy, steel, infrastructure (rail/road), oil and gas as select companies have adequately deleveraged last year.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRating companies are optimistic about higher ratings for borrowers, but surging inflation and its potential impact on growth could restrain the quantum of debt on balance sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œHowever, capex related borrowing would not be widespread but limited amid the evolving economic scenario,\" Ravichandran said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total number of upgrades was 3,564, versus 1,267 downgrades during FY22. This was in stark contrast to the preceding year, which witnessed 2,276 upgrades vis-Ã\\xa0-vis 2,096 downgrades.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical companies along with entities from pharmaceutical, ferrous metals, power, road and constructions sectors made up the largest share of upgrades.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe uptrend in the credit quality can be attributed to higher demand with the economy opening up,â€\\x9d said Sachin Gupta, chief rating officer at CARE Ratings.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spending on infrastructure and dedicated schemes such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and Production Linked Incentives (PLI) has helped improve creditworthiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe impact of the China + 1 strategy aided the recovery to a large extent,â€\\x9d Gupta said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral global companies are looking beyond China to prevent recurrence of supply disruptions caused in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. India is set to benefit from such a de-risking strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareEdge Ratings has clocked a decadal high credit ratio at 2.64 in the second half of the fiscal year on a standalone basis, which points toward a positive credit outlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe sharp rise in the aggregate credit ratio for the credit rating agencies clearly reflects the steady revival of the domestic economy in FY22 despite a couple of bouts of the Covid pandemic,â€\\x9d said Suman Chowdhury, chief analytics officer, Acuite Ratings & Research.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œIt also reflects the expectations of healthy growth in FY23 amid the governmentâ€™s thrust on the infrastructure segment, solid coverage on vaccination, and moderate recovery in rural consumption,â€\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevival is, however, likely to be partly offset by high crude oil prices and higher than expected inflationary pressures. Higher commodity prices will also weigh on corporate margins, leaving companies with limited elbow room for passing on increased costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile local funding costs will likely rise this fiscal year, the US Federal Reserve policy on liquidity unwinding/rate increases would also help chart out future growth potential of companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Ratio, according to Crisil Rating, may moderate due to two reasons: High commodity prices and lower cost savings due to higher travel-related expenses for corporate executives.\\r\\n'\n",

      " \"AgenciesIndia's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. ETIntelligence Group: India's top steel companies are expected to take a hit on their profitability because of the increase in export duty. Domestic steel prices have fallen 8% since the duty was increased late last month and may correct further, say analysts, even though manufacturers had guided for a limited impact from the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, since the beginning of the ongoing fiscal year on April 1, domestic steel prices have come down by 17%, and are now below their year-ago levels. However, raw material prices remain elevated, which would weigh on the performance of steelmakers such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and SAIL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the fall in domestic prices is linked to the duty hike, as international steel prices (Chinese FOB prices) are down only 9% since April 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteel prices are currently around â‚¹63,500 a tonne compared with â‚¹67,000 in June last year. During the same period, the prices of key raw materials, coking coal and iron ore increased by 140% and 49%, respectively. This could lead to a sharp reduction in profitability for the steel manufacturers in FY23.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust to give a perspective, Ebitda/tonne for the March quarter for Tata Steel (India), JSW Steel, JSP and SAIL were lower by 30%, 48.5%, 47% and 55%, respectively, from their peak (in the quarter ended June 30, 2021). For Tata Steel, the impact was the least because it owns iron ore mines. The coming quarters could see a further deterioration in this performance, as analysts say the likely fall in exports due to the higher duty would not be offset by local consumption, as the domestic market cannot absorb the excess capacity created over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgencies\\r\\nIndia's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. The capacity has increased close to 7% over the past 15 years, while consumption has increased by a little over 5%. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn FY22, India exported 13.5 MT (18.5 MT including semifinished steel). Out of this close to 10.5 MT were of flat, cold-rolled and other value-added products. Companies have said on record that they will continue to export these value-added products, at the cost of their profitability, as they cannot stop business with clients developed over the years. The remaining 3 MT (8.5 MT including semifinished steel) will be routed to the domestic market, which will lead to higher local supplies and thus lower realisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings for steel companies are very sensitive to external factors. In the past, these companies have seen from going highly profitable to loss-making in less than a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopments over the past few weeks have left some analysts downgrading earnings estimates of the sector. The estimated earnings for FY23 for the top four players are expected to be significantly lower - for some, less than half - compared with FY22. However, valuations remain on the higher side, so investors may be better off avoiding these stocks.\"\n",

Combined, the total yield -- what the firm called its â€œreverse Fed modelâ€\\x9d -- stands at 7.2% today, even with the runup in bond rates. Thatâ€™s lower than 93% of the time since data began in 1962. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorse, income from the assets is dwindling due to inflation. With consumer-price increases running at 8.5%, itâ€™s the first time in six decades that the combined asset yields have sat below the inflation rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\nâ€œHistorically, investors have been more diligent to reprice stocks and bonds to ensure there is reward for taking on the added risk,â€\\x9d Michael Oâ€™Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in an interview. â€œThe market believes the Fed will blink at the first sign of asset price weakness.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat two major financial assets are so richly priced conceivably creates trouble for investors who just endured their worst quarter in decades, going by the breadth of losses across markets. Stocks and bonds have fallen this year in a rare concerted selloff as the Federal Reserve turned hawkish, embarking on whatâ€™s expected to the most aggressive rate-hike cycle since 1994. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 4.4%, the S&P 500â€™s earnings yield -- the higher-is-cheaper reciprocal of the more widely followed price-earnings ratio -- sports one of the lowest readings in decades. The rate on 10-year Treasuries, despite reaching a three-year high of 2.78% Monday, offers less than half what it has done historically. \\r\\n\\r\\nStocks look expensive as well based on other metrics. Roughly 17% of members in the Russell 3000 Index are trading at more than 10 times their revenues, a proportion that exceeded even the dot-com era, according data compiled by Strategas Securities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\nâ€œWhile it is true that the share prices for many of the high flyers are down dramatically, there could be more room for them to decline,â€\\x9d said Ryan Grabinski, a strategist at Strategas. â€œOne has to wonder how much investors will be willing to pay for these speculative names when the cost of capital is no longer free. Not to mention many of these companies produce zero profits and more often than not, require additional capital to fund their businesses.â€\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nFor his â€œreverse Fed model,â€\\x9d Oâ€™Rourke at JonesTrading adapted a framework that according to a July 1997 report by the central bank compares the relative value of stocks and bonds to identify a more attractive asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eyes of Oâ€™Rourke, both assets are priced as if they are in a bubble, inflated by an unprecedented period of Fed monetary support.

Traders must bring in at least 50% of their futures and options margin requirement in cash starting Monday, while brokers cannot use the cash of one client for anotherâ€™s margin requirement to fulfil their margin requirement with stock exchanges. The moves are expected to drive up the capital requirement for brokers and could make it more expensive for traders.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill now, brokers allowed trading clients to use pledged shares as collateral to initiate trades. Though clients were always required to bring in 50% of their total collateral in cash, brokers never enforced it. This is because exchangesâ€™ clearing corporations recognized margin requirements at the broker level, allowing firms to use cash from one client to make up for the deficiencies of others in its margin pool. The regulator felt that the arrangement of allowing the use of idle cash of one client to make up for the short-fall of others despite taking shares as collateral posed systemic risks, prompting it to tighten rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Monday, clearing corporations must maintain separate margin accounts for every client of brokers. This makes it necessary for clients to bring in 50% cash as collateral to initiate trades. This means, if the margin required for a trade is Rs1 lakh, she must bring in Rs50,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrokers can however fund the 50% cash collateral requirement, which clients need to bring, from its own capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThe new Sebi rule is clear that if you (broker) want to fund a client, do that with your own money; not with another clientâ€™s money,â€\\x9d said the chief executive of a leading broking firm, who did not want to be identified.\\r\\nMORE STORIES FOR YOUâœ•Trading in global stocks through GIFT IFSC: A win-win propositionMunger says retail trading firm Robinhood getting comeuppanceTraders Guide: How to identify low-risk trading strategies?Â« Back to recommendation storiesI don\\'t want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT\\r\\nBroking officials said the race will now be on the basis of which firm is able to offer better funding to larger clients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some brokers will charge interest for funding the cash collateral, which essentially raises the cost of trading,â€\\x9d said B Gopkumar, MD and CEO, Axis Securities. Axis will not charge interest on cash margins, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nZerodha, the countryâ€™s largest broker, said in its website that it would charge 0.035% per day or 12.5% per annum on the â€œshortfall in the cash margin requirementâ€\\x9d. Various other large brokerages are believed to have informed clients that they will charge interest if 50% cash margins are not met.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop broking executives said this rule could force firms to cough up more capital to service clients. The top official at another bank-owned broking firm said the cost of capital for brokers could go up by 18-25%. That would intensify the battle for market share in the ultra-competitive domestic broking industry, which works on low brokerage rates and wafer-thin margins.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œWhile the rule will be a big boost to the transparency levels in the industry, this will squeeze out some of the smaller brokers,â€\\x9d said Gopkumar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome smaller broking firms may however be tempted to stick to the old margin rules a bit longer as the penalty for not complying with the new rules will be imposed from July 1, said industry officials.\\r\\n'\n",

But a decision will have to be made especially as a committee to evaluate this feasibility more than two years ago has submitted its report,\" said the CEO of a life insurance company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nine-member committee co-chaired by LIC chairman MR Kumar and former New India Assurance chairman G Srinivasan was formed in February 2020 to examine the feasibility and business scope for life insurance companies to offer indemnity-based health plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMORE STORIES FOR YOUâœ•Private sector general insurers lead market share growth in AprilMotor insurers asked to stop ads displaying services not part of coverLIC makes muted debut, lists at 9% discount on stock exchangesÂ« Back to recommendation storiesI don\\'t want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT\"The committee had sent its recommendation more than one-and-a-half years ago. But since the life insurance members were outnumbered in the committee, all it could suggest was allowing life insurance companies to be distributors of health plans, though the demand has always been to enable life insurers to offer health because it is a natural combination rather than clubbing it with general insurance products like motor,\" said a member of the committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustry captains say a new chief at the Irdai along with the recent public listing of LIC could alter the status quo in the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new Irdai chairman wants things to move. But more importantly, since now LIC is listed, it is in the government\\'s interest to make sure it is profitable, and this is one way of doing it. Allowing LIC to offer health will open up a whole new segment, so the key is with the government. It is also important to see what are LIC\\'s views on this since previously they have been reluctant to venture into new areas as they were always under pressure to fulfil the government mandate,\" said the CEO cited above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllowing life insurers to offer health plans will dent the fortunes of standalone health insurers and general insurance companies. The regulator will also have to take into account their complaints, especially at a time when there has been increased awareness of these products post-Covid.\\r\\n\\r\\nA research paper by the National Insurance Academy released earlier this month said that health insurance premium collected has jumped to â‚¹73,330 crore in FY22 from â‚¹58,572 crore a year ago and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 24%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This has been a proposal which has been in the works but a decision has not been made yet. There are other issues which are also under consideration, so it is not as if this decision is next in line,\" said a senior Irdai official. The regulator could not be immediately reached for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the proposed reforms in life insurance are the standardisation of products and simplifying regulations, more specifically on calculations of management expenses for these companies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this move is probably more important because it has ramifications throughout the insurance industry,\" said the CEO cited above.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear whether Irdai would want to take a fresh look at health insurance or will rely on already existing submissions by previous committees in this regard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",

At 9.42 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 1,024.29 points or 1.89 per cent lower at 53,064. Nifty50 was trading at 15,865, down 301 points or 1.87 per cent.

      " \"Shutterstock.comOne of the issues investors often lament during a market correction is how they could not sell at highs and create enough cash to start investing during bear markets. It is an interesting thought, but in todayâ€™s column, I intend to debunk the notion that large cash calls are critical to wealth creation. I will submit that cash calls have more to do with behavioural aspects rather than their statistical benefits when juxtaposed against their opportunity cost. I will conclude that, as investors, we are far better off focusing on investible businesses and the price we should pay for them, rather than inordinately worrying about cash calls. If that interests you, please read on!\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important distinction here is about the fundamental fabric of the economy in which we are making these decisions. An economy does well over a long time when (a) more people work, and (b) people work more efficiently (labour force participation and productivity gains). With people, ideally, we should measure effectiveness, and not efficiency, but I digress. In India, more than 90 million people will join the labour force over the next decade, and we are continuously finding more ways to be efficient. Accordingly, the conclusions for Indiaâ€™s investments will be different from what has transpired in Japan over the past three decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite that, retail investors in India own just 8% of the market (16% including mutual funds), but that constitutes an even smaller percentage of their overall savings. For a vast majority of retail investors, stock markets are no longer considered akin to gambling casinos, but we are still far away from where equities are a must-have allocation in oneâ€™s savings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, to this reading cohort, I donâ€™t have to enlist the benefits of equity as in an investible asset class, I will take it as a given. In that case, the only decision that we must make is regarding the approach. To me, using leverage is not sustainable as a universal strategy. Leverage makes us terribly path-dependent. If we buy a certain stock at 100 on leverage (the fair price of which we believe is 150), and the stock dips to 70 before it reaches 150, we might be forced to liquidate. We build an acceptable path (for leverage to sustain) based on what has happened in the past. But increasingly, things that have not happened in the past are happening all the time now (markets had never corrected 30% in a month before COVID, and no market recovery had happened in a straight line before 2021). And any strategy where ruin is a possible scenario, however low, the a priori probability is unlikely to yield long-term success across all practitioners (ergo, not a universal strategy. Works with a few, and we celebrate the winners. But those who leveraged and got wiped off, we donâ€™t know them!).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Indiaâ€™s economy is on a strong fundamental foundation and equity as an asset class deserves allocation within our savings and leverage is not an alternative, the only question that remains to be answered is - should we always stay invested in the market, or keep getting in and out (either fully or partially â€“ aka, take large cash calls)?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chart below compares the long-term returns of an investor who managed to invest all their surplus at the absolute market bottom (dark red bar) versus an investor who kept investing regularly (grey bar). Despite the huge market correction in the Global Financial Crises (light red bar), the difference in long-term returns of both investors is not material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher value of the red bar over the grey bar is assuming that the investor can accurately time the market. The difference between the two bars then, is the benefit of cash calls, if you will. Now let us look at the costs. Over the last three decades (13,500 days), if an investor missed just the best 10 days of the market, the investor returns would have been 65% lower. Miss 30 days and returns fall by a whopping 92%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nPut another way, if an investor absolutely nails the market bottom, the advantage he gains is minuscule compared to the costs (65% and 92% lower returns). The risks are not commensurate for marginally higher returns, in my opinion. Why then, one would wonder, would investors focus so hard on taking these cash calls?\\r\\n\\r\\nI would submit that, for many, it is an emotional issue. Investors donâ€™t consciously calculate the difference in returns that their strategy (higher cash calls) generates but derive huge comfort and satisfaction when they are able to invest in market corrections. It â€˜feelsâ€™ like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction, but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would propose a different approach to cash calls. Rather than letting it be an input parameter ('markets are expensive, so letâ€™s create cashâ€™), let cash be an output of articulated actions. For us, a good business is a great investment only when we pay the right price for it. Admittedly, there are different ways to arrive at the â€œright priceâ€\\x9d (we use reverse discounted cash flows), but when the price of the businesses we own gets too high, and we do not get decent businesses to buy, thatâ€™s when the cash percentage should increase. If that coincides with markets topping out, so be it. This approach will ensure an investorâ€™s mental bandwidth is utilized in arriving at the right business to own, and the right price to pay versus incessantly worrying about market movement and behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(The author is Co-Founder & Director, Buoyant Capital.)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Ad revenues are crucial for profitability, and the company expects the same to normalise in 3-4 months. It raises EBITDA estimates by 10-30% over FY23E-FY24E as we increase our ATP assumption.

Besides this, the Nifty so far has held the double bottom formed near the immediate low point of this range. The most immediate resistance that the index has is the 50-week MA which presently stands at 17056; this again makes the zone of 16400-17000 yet another trading zone for the index. \\r\\nApart from this, volatility too declined during the week; INDIA VIX came off by 7.01% to 19.98.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coming week stays crucial for the markets.

It would be extremely important to stay with the right kind of stock.

Asset quality improved, with GNPA at ~6%, led by negative net slippages, while the restructured pool remained largely steady at ~2.8% of loans. Overall loan growth (+9% YoY) was driven by commercial (+12%), agri (+13%) and home loans (+9%). KVB is incrementally focused on driving granular growth (LAP, commercial banking, and other retail) and has guided for a 12% loan growth in FY23. With a steady NIM trajectory and improving line of sight on lower credit costs, KVB is wellplaced to inch closer to its ~1% RoA target.

      " 'PTIICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank and Bank of India are among the leading local lenders that Thursday raised their external reference benchmarks, used largely for pricing retail loans, a day after Reserve Bank of India increased its key rate for the second time in as many months to restrain inflation. About half of the country\\'s outstanding banking credit is linked to external rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese banks raised their respective external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) by 50 basis points (bps), matching the latest increase in the repo, or the rate at which RBI lends short-term funds to commercial banks. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\\r\\n\\r\\nICICI Bank\\'s EBLR now stands at 8.6%, up from 8.1% before. \"ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate (I-EBLR) is referenced to the RBI policy repo rate, with a mark-up over the repo rate,\" the bank said on its web site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail Loans Linked to EBLR \\r\\n Public sector lender Bank of Baroda said its EBLR rate now stands at 7.4%, effective June 9. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just like they had declined sharply, rates will normalise in a similar manner,\" said Sanjiv Chadha, MD, Bank of Baroda. \"EBLR-linked loans are 30-35% of our portfolio.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Bank of Baroda, about 40% of the loans are linked to an internal reference gauge, or the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR). \"In MCLR, the increase will be more gradual because it is linked to the deposit costs, which will rise depending on how the liquidity situation moves,\" said Chadha.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll banks will automatically pass on the entire repo rate increase to customers that borrowed funds linked to external benchmarks. In the case of loans priced on MCLR or a \\'fixed\\' rate, the asset liability committees of the respective banks are expected to decide on the quantum of increase in loan costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 40% of all outstanding bank loans are linked to the EBLR currently, and another 30% are linked to MCLR. The remaining are fixed-rate loans. All fresh retail and MSME loans are linked to EBLR, while corporate loans are linked to MCLR.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector lender Punjab National Bank said its repo-linked lending rate will be 7.4%, effective June 9. Bank of India also revised its rates 50 bps higher to 7.75%. The Central Bank and RBL Bank, too, raised their EBLRs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparately, Kotak Mahindra Bank announced a rise in its interest rates on savings accounts and fixed deposits. Daily balances in savings accounts above Rs 50 lakh will earn 50 basis points higher - or 4%. \\r\\n\\r\\n Rates on fixed deposits have been increased in the range of 10 to 25 basis points. Mortgage lender HDFC too announced an increase in its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on housing loans by 50 basis points with effect from June 10. Its home loans now start from 7.55%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediate Transmission\\r\\n\\r\\n\"EBLR will move in tandem with the entire regulatory movement. Since retail loans are linked to EBLR, the transmission will happen,\" said Shanti Ekambaram, Group President - Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank. \"It\\'s clear that we will see another few rounds of rate hikes, which could take the repo rate to 5.5%-6%. The market rates have gone up much sharper; so we felt that our savers should also get reasonable returns.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, private lender HDFC Bank increased its MCLR by 35 basis points across loan tenors, making loans expensive for existing borrowers. The new MCLR will now range between 7.5% and 8.05%.

      "['Banks holding on to subsidy share, say payments firms The companies have written to the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI), complaining that a,1700 crore of the a,11,500 crore granted in the budget is being retained by banks. ReutersPayments companies and banks are at loggerheads over the sharing of government-granted subsidies for building payment infrastructure, said three people with knowledge of the matter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe companies have written to the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI), complaining that a,1700 crore of the a,11,500 crore granted in the budget is being retained by banks, they said. This has deprived companies connecting up the last mile of state-promised revenues, according to them. The government granted the subsidies in exchange for waiving Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) charges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The government has released a,1700 crore worth of subsidies to banks but they are not sharing it with any payment aggregators,\" said the CEO of a payments company on condition of anonymity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCompensation for MDR Waiver \\r\\n \"We have taken up the matter with NPCI, which is the nodal agency but the feedback that we got is that we should take the matter up with respective banks, but they are not responding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a Rs 1,500 crore fund to hasten the expansion of India\\'s digital payments industry, a move that was seen as compensating for the waiver of MDR on the use of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay cards in her previous budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n Payment aggregators are entitled to receive a 15 basis point subvention on small-value digital transactions. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have asked all banks for whom we process transactions on the RuPay debit cards--they are not sharing any subsidy amount with us,\" said another CEO. \"Payment aggregators put in so much effort to acquire transactions on the RuPay platform when most banks were either surrendering these cards or going slow on expansion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBanks didn\\'t respond to queries on the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the cost of digital payment services such as switching fees or interchange fees is borne by one or more of the payment system participants or is passed on to merchants through the MDR or ultimately levied on the customer as additional charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it will carry out a comprehensive review of all aspects related to charges involved in various channels of digital payments in the recently released Payments Vision 2025 document.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We believe this review could result in relatively higher credit card and wallet MDRs and the introduction of MDR on UPI to at least cover the cost,\" said Anand Dama, senior research analyst, Emkay Global.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the adoption of electronic payments has surged, concerns abound over viability. Total digital payments rose 216% and 10% in terms of volume and value, respectively, in March from the year earlier, according to RBI data.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, usage of paper instruments such as cheques declined significantly during the period, with their share in total retail payments registering a decline from 3.83% to 0.88% in terms of volume and from 19.62% to 11.47% in terms of value.', 'Digitally ready Bank of Baroda aims to click on more loans At present, 50% of the bank\\'s retail loans are sourced digitally. Out of this, 97% of the bank\\'s personal loans are disbursed end-to-end digitally while the bulk of the home loan originations is done digitally.  AgenciesThe bank presently has 20 million active users on its mobile app, with plans to reach 30 million customers in a year\\'s time.After overhauling its IT infrastructure to set up digital banking departments internally, public sector lender Bank of Baroda is now targeting at least 65% of retail originations and 35% of MSME loans (value-wise) to be done digitally by the end of the current fiscal year. The bank is also targeting a,150,000 crore of digital lending in the current fiscal year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We believe that this year we will disburse loans of over a,150,000 crore through our digital bank this year alone,\" said Akhil Handa, chief digital officer, Bank of Baroda. \"This will be a combination of retail (home, auto, personal) loans and small ticket MSME loans (Mudra loans and small ticket business loans). We have a substantial advantage over peer banks that are getting started with their digital journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHanda added that at least a,135,000 crore-a,140,000 crore will come from lending to the retail sector, while the balance will be contributed by the MSME segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, 50% of the bank\\'s retail loans are sourced digitally. Out of this, 97% of the bank\\'s personal loans are disbursed end-to-end digitally while the bulk of the home loan originations is done digitally.

But for how long? Fiscal dominance occurs when the govtaEUR(tm)s finances- for instance, the cost at which it borrows- take priority and force the monetary authorityaEUR(tm)s hand on interest rates, hurting its power to fight the inflation.  Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it. \\r\\n\\r\\naEURoeThis is a scenario of fiscal dominance, in which policy rates rise by much less than we expect in 2022, but macro risks aEUR\" both inflation and external aEUR\" could be much higher than our current baseline,aEUR Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote in a Feb. 25 note. aEURoeWe see a potential stagflationary outcome in this scenario.aEUR\\r\\n\\r\\nFiscal dominance occurs when the governmentaEUR(tm)s finances aEUR\" for instance, the cost at which it borrows aEUR\" take priority and force the monetary authorityaEUR(tm)s hand on interest rates, hurting its power to fight inflation. That isnaEUR(tm)t the case in India right now. In early May, when the fiction of transient inflation became impossible to keep up, the Indian central bank surprised the market with an unscheduled 40 basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate. It followed up Wednesday by raising the policy rate by another 50 basis points, though this time the tightening was widely expected. For now, it doesnaEUR(tm)t look like the fiscal authority is keen to dissuade the central bank from doing its job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 7.8%, the pace of annual price increases is at an eight-year high and still climbing. In other words, itaEUR(tm)s early days in IndiaaEUR(tm)s battle against inflation, and the finance ministry might yet lose its nerve if, in the process of containing price pressures, the RBI pushes up bond yields too high, complicating the governmentaEUR(tm)s plan to raise money by selling a record 14.31 trillion rupees ($184 billion) of notes this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesnaEUR(tm)t seem to be rattled. If anything, New Delhi has announced a $26 billion package, which includes tax cuts on fuel, to help the RBI keep a lid on inflation. That package is unlikely to be a substitute for more rate increases; it might even enlarge the public borrowing plan. To this, add Wednesday\\'s increase in prices for monsoon-sown crops aEUR\" including rice -- that the government will pay farmers to procure their harvests for public distribution. Money will have to be found for this, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has to assure New Delhi that its borrowing program would get completed without pushing the 10-year yield much higher than the current level of around 7.5%, a three-year high. The question is, can Das really hold the line on long-term bond yields? And will the government change its carefree tune if he canaEUR(tm)t. Luckily for Das, so far thereaEUR(tm)s been nothing of the 2015 bluster when, according to a recent Al Jazeera expose by The ReportersaEUR(tm) Collective, the top bureaucrat in the finance ministry had internally sought an investigation into then Governor Raghuram RajanaEUR(tm)s decision to keep interest rates high, by which he was allegedly helping aEURoethe white manaEUR aEUR\" shorthand for investors in rich nations aEUR\" at the cost of domestic investment and growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter RajanaEUR(tm)s 2016 decision to return to the University of Chicago, the friction carried over to his successor. Governor Urjit Patel came under pressure on everything from interest rates aEUR\" which by now were being decided by a monetary policy committee aEUR\" to his management of surging corporate bad debt and, finally, the question of whether the RBI had more capital than it needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nPatelaEUR(tm)s deputy was mocked for warning the government of the consequences of raiding the RBIaEUR(tm)s coffers. Following PatelaEUR(tm)s abrupt resignation in December 2018, his job went to Das, a former finance-ministry mandarin who had executed ModiaEUR(tm)s draconian currency ban in late 2016. A new period of peaceful coexistence between the fiscal and monetary authorities began, and gained momentum during the pandemic when such cooperation became the norm globally. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, the pandemic is over, and new sources of friction are cropping up. On rate increases, the central bank and the finance ministry may be singing from the same hymn book, but the question of the RBIaEUR(tm)s capital is beginning to simmer, thanks to the lowest dividend the ministry has received from the RBI in a decade: a little less than $4 billion, or a third of last yearaEUR(tm)s payout.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucially, even this reduced dividend has been made possible by the central bank simultaneously selling $97 billion from its foreign-currency reserves in the spot market and buying $114 billion. Ignore the purchases. Each dollar thataEUR(tm)s sold is valued its weighted average cost of acquisition in the past. Since that figure is lower than the current exchange rate, selling dollars for around 78 rupees today means a profit, which is then shared with New Delhi. Without this aEURoeactive conversion of revaluation gains into realized profits, the RBI would have required a net capital injection from the government,aEUR according to Observatory Group analyst Ananth Narayan. \\r\\n\\r\\nA reduction in the balance sheet also helped rein in the RBIaEUR(tm)s capital requirement, and prevented its dividend from going to zero, Narayan says. That tug of war aEUR\" whether RBI would give money to the government or tap it for funds aEUR\" might remain in check once again if the central bankaEUR(tm)s assets donaEUR(tm)t swell this year, either. That may well be the case since thereaEUR(tm)s hardly any dollar inflow into India now, only outflow. Still, the RBIaEUR(tm)s economic capital, which according to NarayanaEUR(tm)s calculation has already dipped below the minimum 20.8% of assets set by a 2019 committee, is a mindless constraint. It would never have come about if the finance ministry didnaEUR(tm)t in the past lust after the RBIaEUR(tm)s capital. To have to depend on politicians for money isnaEUR(tm)t a good outcome for an institution that has to project its autonomy to make its war on inflation credible. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndiaaEUR(tm)s fragile government finances mean that the risk of fiscal dominance of monetary policy always lurks in the background. Right now, it isnaEUR(tm)t a big threat because inflation is giving an unexpected boost to the tax revenue. But as NomuraaEUR(tm)s Nandi says, monetary tightening is aEURoefar from the finishing line.aEUR Barely two months into the job, Das cut rates in a surprise stimulus ahead of ModiaEUR(tm)s May 2019 re-election bid. That was then. Now that the cycle has turned, it will be interesting to see if the RBI chief can keep his political masters in good humor. Or if his relationship with the government aEUR\" like that of his two predecessors aEUR\" will also start to fray. \\r\\n', 'New investment, manufacturing jumped in FY22: Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs on Wednesday said that new investments and ordering activities witnessed a sharp pick-up in FY22 and the manufacturing sector, which has lagged for multiple years, jumped 210%, compared to 2020-21.

According to the United Nations, by 2050 more than five billion people could be affected by water scarcity. India, which constitutes 16% of the total world population, has access to a meagre 4% of the worldaEUR(tm)s water resources. The success of our pilot project in Uttarakhand will impact other farmers to shift towards climate compatible crops without having an impact on yield and returns.aEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nFarmers of Udham Singh Nagar and adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh (Rampur, Bareilly, and Pilibhit) traditionally take up a short duration summer paddy crop after their Rabi harvest and before Kharif sowing. Based on research, Gram Unnati identified Maize as a reasonably remunerative substitute for summer paddy. Maize is not only a short-duration crop, requiring less water compared to paddy but is also known to bring higher returns. Its multiple utilities such as aEUR~foodaEUR(tm), aEUR~fodderaEUR(tm), and aEUR~feedaEUR(tm) help in de-risking farmers against potential low-demand situations. \\r\\n\\r\\naEURoeThe pilot project was successful in moving 5,000 acres of land to spring maize, which resulted in substantial water savings of as much as 4,000 litres per acre.

Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how one\\'s life affects the community and working towards overall well-being. ThinkStock PhotosIn every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context.Sustainability has imploded as an agenda with unprecedented scope and significance. India\\'s movement for a Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) is now in the global spotlight as a premier initiative for nurturing a \"pro planet people\". It is emerging as a consciously tailored policy for climate change focusing on reducing consumption at an individual level. Embers of LiFE already exist in the country, and there is much to learn from India\\'s environmental history. Understanding the pivotal role of indigenous knowledge systems in preserving ecology is essential for shaping the future of Indian sustainability. Hence, the call for LiFE is about taking a walk down the memory lane, drawing lessons for India\\'s future and implementing it on a larger scale. India has also revised its starting point from state action to individual action. Now the question is, what kind of individual action will create long-standing sustainability in the country? How can we chart a new course for Indian environmentalism through indigenous knowledge and experiences from the ground? The answer is simple; launching movements from the ground and mainstreaming indigenous practices but building momentum for the same is not an easy task.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach country will play to its strengths to achieve ambitious targets, and India should also tap into its rich body of indigenous knowledge. There is no one ideal way to practice sustainability in the country. India has diverse physical and social divisions. The history, experience, and expectations of sustainability in Meghalaya will significantly differ from Kerala\\'s. The first step is toward building environmental literacy within communities. When we talk about changing individual behaviour and lifestyle for the environment, it must be noted that the individual and the collective are closely entwined for preserving the environment. Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how one\\'s life affects the community and working towards overall well-being.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context. In 2021, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation recognised eight sustainable food systems worldwide, out of which two are from Meghalaya and Uttarakhand in India. The Khasi tribes from Nongtraw village in Meghalaya received global attention for their diverse traditional food systems like Jhum supported by livestock farming and other practices that respect local agro-biodiversity. This enabled the village to produce and consume quality yield even with supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. Similarly, the Bhotias and Anwals of Uttrakhand follow ancestral nomadism and agro-pastoralism, which helps them meet 60% of the community\\'s food consumption needs. This shows how traditional practices can build resilience in communities and aid climate adaptation efforts. We can also take the example of Indian architecture. The country is now rife with green building consultants, but historically, every part of the country had its locally suited green buildings. Dhajji Dewri in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir are traditional structures built by partially cutting mountain slopes. It is best suited for the region\\'s climatic variations while causing minimal disturbance to the topography. Today it is impossible to travel to the mountains without considering the possibility of landslides and rocks hurling down due to reckless practices. This is only a sneak peek into India\\'s depths of sustainable knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the only way to build a long-standing climate policy is by tapping into the strength of the grassroots and understanding the extent to which environmental movements can empower individuals on the ground. Chipko movement received global attention and is a landmark in the Indian environmental movement, but the starting point was at the community level. A social and yet personal struggle of Chandi Prasad Bhatt to preserve the local forest resources, escaped, connected, and thrived under the umbrella of eco feminism and peasant\\'s movement in the country. If we look at the history of environmental movements in India, be it Narmada Bachao Andolan or the Niyamgiri movement, the first call for action always comes from the ground, from a personal anecdote, because fear is not thrilling when you\\'re the one who is afraid. Also, the unique potential for LiFE lies in the fact that all humans, all Indians, are embedded and nurtured on the same earth. Besides, with increasing mobility and interconnectedness, we know the extent to which a tropical cyclone in Odisha can affect neighbouring states and communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle for Environment should therefore emanate from India\\'s pre-existing pockets of indigenous knowledge, and the rest of the country should embrace these learnings from the ground. India has the right policy ecosystem and governance support for reinventing its sustainability movement. All Indian states incentivise eco-friendly practices like organic farming, electric mobility, and renewable energy infrastructure. Adapting them to local contexts, linking sustainability with community practices and sharing best practices with the world is the way forward to build momentum for a Lifestyle for Environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmit Kapoor is chair, Institute for Competitiveness; visiting scholar and lecturer at Stanford University.

Indian corporates will have to think twice before tossing \\'guarantees\\' and \\'letters of comfort\\' to help group companies raise money, notch up credit ratings, and bargain a lower interest rate on the back of such support from parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules of the game on \\'corporate guarantees\\' will change with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) insisting on a water-tight, time-bound mechanism for the issuance of guarantees and their invocation by lending banks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a week ago, in a \"guidance note\" to credit rating agencies, the banking regulator has said that banks have to formally agree to a time frame within which they would invoke a guarantee following a loan default while the corporate guarantor has to commit to a deadline to pay up once the invocation by lenders takes place, a senior industry person told ET.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating agencies have been advised by the regulator to perform legal due diligence and ensure that the right structures and agreements are in place so that lenders, as well as borrowers, stick to a formally agreed timeline on invocation and loan repayment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA corporate guarantee is a promise by the parent to assume the debt obligation of a group company if the latter fails to repay or service a loan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Banks rarely pull the trigger soon after a default. They try to negotiate and assess the situation. They may also delay the guarantee invocation to preserve business relationships with the group whose other group companies may be giving good business to the bank. Also, it could be an old client. Besides, recovering a loan through a guarantee invocation can be timing consuming,\" said a senior banker.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a borrower refuses to repay post guarantee invocation, banks have to move the court or initiate proceedings at a Debts Recovery Tribunal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But a timeline spelt out in a guarantee document would certainly put extra pressure on a company to behave as it knows the bank is bound to act. I feel putting an end to open-ended corporate guarantees is a step in the right direction,\" said another person. \"Traditionally, banks never set a timeframe when a guarantee would be invoked. We have to figure out how this would work,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 90% of the 50,000 debt ratings in the country are on bank loans. Banks prefer rating on loans as risk weightage on such assets comes down, letting lenders preserve some capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rating on a loan which has a corporate guarantee carries the tag \\'CE\\' (or, \\'credit enhancement\\'.) This improves the rating on the loan by at least one notch than it would have fetched without parent support. The RBI note relates to such loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nRBI also said that an arm of a foreign company in India cannot be given \\'CE\\' rating unless the overseas parent has a rating from one of the top three rating agencies in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, for non-loan debts, like non-convertible debentures or NCDs - a preferred borrowing route for several corporates - \\'CE\\' on a rating does not reflect explicit support from the parent. Instead, it simply indicates that some extra cushion, like cash collateral, is set aside by the borrower to give a degree of comfort to financial creditors subscribing to the NCDs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of securities which are \\'guaranteed\\', rating agencies use the nomenclature \\'SO\\' (or, structured obligation). But agencies add \\'SO\\' to only ratings of securitised papers, like pass-through certificates, which though similar to bonds are riskier instruments and whose servicing of interest and principal repayment depends on the cash flow generated by an underlying pool of loans. Thus, what \\'SO\\' is to a securitised paper, \\'CE\\' is to a bank loan. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"The guarantee structure for NCDs was streamlined by Sebi. Now RBI is doing it for bank loans which form the bulk of the ratings,\" said a source in the loan market.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuarantees cannot be invoked once lenders initiate action under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against a corporate borrower and their petition is accepted by the National Company Law Tribunal - a quasi-judicial authority set up to deal with corporate disputes. There is a standstill on payouts to creditors by the company concerned once IBC proceedings begin.\\r\\n\\r\\n', \"Banks could be best sector, consumption looks strong: Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai Given that India is at the beginning of a potentially large and long growth cycle, I am quite okay with valuations. They are not extended or too cheap, said Ridham Desai replying to a question AgenciesMorgan Stanley India's Ridham Desai This is like a mid-bull market type of correction, said Morgan Stanley's head of India research Ridham Desai. In an interview with Sanam Mirchandani and Nishanth Vasudevan ahead of the firm's annual India conference, Desai said he is bullish on banks, consumer discretionary and technology. Edited excerpts:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow are you reading Indian market valuations after the recent fall?\\r\\nGiven that India is at the beginning of a potentially large and long growth cycle, I am quite okay with valuations. They are not extended or too cheap. At this point in the market cycle what matters is the growth cycle rather than valuations. We are at the mid-cycle stage; the early pickings are done when the valuation re-rates in anticipation of higher growth. The next stage is likely driven by growth rather than multiple expansion. This is like a mid-bull market type of correction. The global growth tailwind will not be as strong as it was in 2003-2007.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's valuations have always been at a premium. Are they justified given the macro headwinds?\\r\\nEmerging markets as a cohort are no longer the same as it was 20 years ago. Certain EMs are totally broken in macro terms. Comparing India with that cohort is becoming less and less relevant. I would want to look at this relative to India's own history. If you look at price to book, we are kind of on a par with history. Of course, the ROEs (return on equity) are below history. The market is anticipating a new ROE cycle. The ROE will probably get to around 20%, but I don't know whether we will get to 24%. Another thing is the GDP growth number. We averaged nearly 9% between 2003 and 2008. It is going to not go at that rate. The economy is very differently sized so it is unlikely to deliver the same type of real growth and that also impacts ROE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich investment themes are you betting on?\\r\\nThe banking space is our largest overweight position. In the next 12 to 18 months, banks could probably end up being the best performing sector. In banking, we have improving credit growth, falling credit costs and potentially rising NIMs (net interest margins) as rates go up. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing to watch out for is discretionary consumption. There's a revival in jobs and wages, and there is also pent-up demand coming out of the Covid lockdowns. Discretionary consumption looks very strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also like tech. The US recession is not our base case but if it happens, then there will be some cutback on spending, and that will hurt Indian tech companies. A lot of them have surprised us on the upside with their transition from enterprise to digital over the last five-seven years. We are underweight everything else including healthcare, energy, materials and utilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAre the IT stock valuations cheap after the recent sell-off?\\r\\nNo, they are not. Their growth profile has shifted so they ought to be trading better than history especially if you take a 10-year period. If you take a 25-year history, then it is okay because they had gone into bubble territory at the end of the 90s. The correction reflects the concerns that both the US markets and Indian tech stocks have expressed about a potential US recession or a material slowdown in growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003-2010 period belonged to infrastructure, 2010 to 2020 was consumption. Do you think this decade will belong to infrastructure again?\\r\\nI would almost go to the extent of saying the stars are aligned for a major revival in India's manufacturing sector. The sector has lost share in GDP persistently over the last 20-25 years. A lot of things have changed in the last few years. We have competitive tax rates and corporations are looking to diversify away from China on an incremental basis and looking to come to India to set up production facilities. The government is trying direct cash incentives to companies to invest in India. Manufacturing would be the thing to watch out for in the next ten years.\\r\\n\", 'Govt giving additional fertiliser subsidy of Rs 1.10 lakh crore this fiscal: FM Nirmala Sitharaman Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had recently said the total fertiliser subsidy bill could be between Rs 2-2.5 lakh crore in the current fiscal due to a sharp rise in global prices.

To sustain a hassle free retirement, retirement planning should be our foremost task. ET SpotlightThe fact that Indians shy away from discussing retirement plans has a lot to do with our lack of financial literacy. Most of us have spent many precious minutes fantasizing about the day when we can retire and won't have to go to work. We dream about a happy retirement, imagining ourselves taking a break from all responsibilities. However, only a few of us will be able to live this ideal retirement life when the time eventually comes to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a certain age, we're all faced with the responsibility of looking after our aging parents but we fail to remember that the same fate awaits our children too when we meet our retirement age, unless we ensure adequate retirement planning ahead of time. For example, a stable retirement fund ensures that we're never financially vulnerable and can afford any care we require. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, experts believe there are three important reasons why retirement planning should be a priority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can't work forever. Many of us want to work post-retirement too. But will the meagre income be sustainable? Hence, retirement planning is essential to be financially independent after you stop working.\\r\\nThe future is uncertain, and you might have to make an unplanned large investment. But will it be possible to execute this if you can't work? Good savings and the right investment can help you through unprecedented times and challenges.\\r\\nHealth problems are unavoidable as time passes by. Medical expenses are bound to make a dent in your savings and leave you stranded financially post-recovery.\\r\\nIndia, like several other developed countries, lacks a social security system to care for the aged. There is neither free medical care nor a monthly government pay-out on which pensioners can rely. Even government employees who formerly had the security of a guaranteed pension must now build a corpus because the government has eliminated this benefit for most of its employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why are we not prioritizing retirement plans? How long can we postpone an ever-looming necessity? Beyond the age of 50, one barely has the time and money to plan a joyful retirement. If this rings a bell for you, here are some of the best tips from industry experts to plan your retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate alternate sources of income.\\r\\nKeep increasing the contribution to your retirement savings every year.\\r\\nDo not rely solely on security schemes.\\r\\n Keep risk factors in mind before investing a considerable sum of money.\\r\\nConsider inflation. Rs. 10 lakhs today will not have the same monetary value 20 years later.\\r\\nStay away from excessive expenditure.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\nIn an environment of rising inflation and market volatility, it's essential to have a retirement fund large enough to last you your lifetime. Otherwise, you risk being compelled to work during your retirement, a situation that no one wants to be in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, you can take a chance and trust that your children will take care of you, but that is a significant leap of faith to make. And even if they are prepared to do so, would you want to burden your offspring with the obligation of providing for your financial well-being in your old age?\\r\\n\\r\\nMaloo Investwise cuts out the confusion over what modes of investment to use for the highest returns on your retirement fund and provides you with a comprehensive financial plan that stands true to the test of time.

ET SpotlightEquity markets have seen a sharp recovery from Covid-19 lows, and continuous investor inflows have pushed the industry assets under management (AUM)* well past the Rs. 38 lakh crore mark for the financial year-ended 31 March 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the AUM* for the equity segment, at Rs. 13.6 lakh crores, surpassed that of the debt segment at Rs. 12.9 lakh crore for the first time. By comparison, just two years ago, in March 2020, equity AUM* stood at just Rs. 7 lakh crore, while debt AUM was at Rs. 10.3 lakh crore. Since then, thereaEUR(tm)s been a continuous month-over-month increase in AUM*. Even when you consider the hybrid schemes or multi-asset schemes, the allocation for equity is much higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, Indian investors have always preferred investing in real estate, gold, and bank fixed deposits (FDs), but poor inflation-adjusted returns for these asset classes have led to a shift in investor preferences. Direct equity is still considered difficult by new investors, and most prefer to enter the markets via the mutual fund route. Between March 2020 and October 2021, benchmark equity indices had more than doubled, attracting many new investors to stock markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that domestic inflows have been steadily increasing even during such tumultuous times over the past two years is a sign of increased investor participation and growing share of household savings into mutual funds. We also find newer investors in recent graduates who have just started working, as well as among the many who have shifted to the work-from-home (WFH) model. They are tech-savvy and adapt easily to online investing. Covid-19 lockdowns and low-interest rates have encouraged investors to start investing in mutual funds. Job uncertainties have also taught us the importance of regular savings, and this discipline reflects in the monthly systematic investment plan (SIPs) inflows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the flows in equity funds have seen robust growth, inflows into debt funds have been poor due to below-par returns, compared to bank FDs. In 2020 and 2021, large-cap funds generated average returns of 15-25 percent*** while most of the shorter-end debt fund categories have given average returns of 3-5 percent*** in the same time frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased participation by retail investors has also led to greater awareness about the various funds offered by asset management companies (AMC). While seasoned investors may prefer to invest directly with the AMCs, new investors prefer to do it via mutual fund distributors (MFD). While direct plans have lesser expenses, regular plans offered by MFDs help newer clients build up portfolios, plan SIPs, and carry out non-financial transactions like KYC updates, address changes, etc with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven senior citizens who earlier relied on a fixed income like deposits and debt funds, are now keen to explore mutual funds which offer better risk-adjusted returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestors are also willing to stay invested for longer, even through periods of volatility. Earlier, retail investors would panic at the slightest dip. But now we see more investors ready to hold on through corrections of 10-15 percent**, with some even using it as an opportunity for lumpsum investments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the pandemic has slowly and steadily instilled a sense of financial discipline in the retail investor, thereby improving their preparedness for a rainy day. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSources:\\r\\n*AMFI AUM data from\\r\\n https://www.amfiindia.com\\r\\n** BSE, NSE indices data from \\r\\nhttps://bseindia.com and https://www.nesindia.com\\r\\n*** Fund returns data from\\r\\n https://www.valueresearchonline.com/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nViews are personal: The author - Adil Behram Driver, is the founder of trademark WAVES aEUR\" Wealth AVEnueS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: T\\r\\nhe views expressed are of the author and are personal.

ET SpotlightWhat if, in a football match, there are 22 players running after a ball but there are no goalposts? DoesnaEUR(tm)t make sense, does it? It doesnaEUR(tm)t.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when it comes to investments, most of us make this mistake. Most people do random savings and invest without financial goals. As the saying goes, aEURoeAn investment without a goal is like a traveller without a destination.aEUR\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy goal-based investing?\\r\\nMoney can be a tool to accomplish greater goals in your life, such as giving your child the best education, pursuing your hobbies, travelling to the destinations youaEUR(tm)ve always wanted, buying your dream home, saving for your golden yearsaEUR| the list goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouaEUR(tm)re closer to achieving your goals when your money goes into goal-based investments rather than random savings. Goal-based investing ensures that you save for each goal in advance, which makes it more likely for you to achieve them. Also, it helps you match your time horizon to your asset allocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore investing your money, you should know the 4Ks - Kya? Kab? Kitna? & Kaise?\\r\\n\\r\\nET Spotlight\\r\\nKya - what is the investment for?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKab - when would you require this money? If you know what your goal is and the time you have in hand, itaEUR(tm)s wiser to invest in equities that work best in the long-term, rather than investing in short-term assets and compromising the return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKitna - how much money would you require? You need to adjust the current cost with the inflation to arrive at the future cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKaise - how much do you need to invest? Investments can be done via SIPs or lump sums. Here, you also need to define your asset allocation, which will depend on your risk appetite. You can get your risk profile test done to arrive at the asset allocation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are some of the behavioural and financial reasons why goal-based investment is a better way of investing:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Avoid under-saving: Goal-based investments make you think and enumerate your goals in advance. This prevents you from miscalculating how much money youaEUR(tm)ll need to invest for your financial goals. Instead of random savings, you will save the appropriate amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Plan ahead, save less, achieve more: Goal-based investing means lesser liabilities. HereaEUR(tm)s how: when you start saving for a goal well ahead of time, you need to save less. Why? Because you will benefit from the power of compounding. The earlier you start saving, the more time there is for the investments to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you require a corpus of Rs. 100 lakhs for your childrenaEUR(tm)s higher education. You need to save just Rs. 17,000/month for 18 years if you start at the time he/she is born. But if you start 5 years later, you need to invest Rs. 31,000/month - 55% more every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturns are assumed at 10% per annum. (Investment amounts are for illustrative purposes only and does not assure any guaranteed returns.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Save for a tangible outcome: Think about the outcome of your investment. When you attach a real outcome to the purpose of your saving, youaEUR(tm)re more likely to work towards that goal. It also discourages you from withdrawing or redeeming the funds in between due to short-term market fluctuation and it keeps you on track.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Guilt-free spending: While some might find it surprising, there are people who feel guilty and are uncomfortable with spending large amounts of money. But when you spend money from an investment specifically earmarked for that purpose, you will spend it without guilt. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5) Achieve optimal returns: Goal-based investing matches your time horizon with your asset allocation, and you can allocate investments according to the time frame of the goal. A bike is best for going around the city, but to go to another country, you need to get on a flight. Similarly, different assets work differently in different time horizons. Goal-based investing ensures that you invest in the most suitable asset depending on your goals to ensure optimum returns. For example, if your goal is 12 years away, equities would be the best way to go. But if your goal is just a couple of years away, equities might not give you the desired results.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you arenaEUR(tm)t investing based on your goals, youaEUR(tm)re just running in a field with a ball, not knowing where to shoot. Start goal-based investing now and win the game!\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Goal-Based Investing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nViews are personal: The author - Abhishek Mohta, CFP & Founder, Trustedarms Wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer:\\r\\nThe views expressed are of the author and are personal.

Cannot affect war factors\" said Madan Sabnavis chief economist, Bank of Baroda. \"But if rates rise and credit slows demand for say cement and steel is curbed which lowers inflation. Companies won\\'t invest unless demand is there. Hence this part of inflation curbed. This holds everywhere in the world.

AgenciesFirst phase of the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) for India started in August 2016 and the next in April 2021, which is due to run till March 2026. The inflation target was renewed with the CPI target kept at 4%, with the upper tolerance level at 6% and the lower tolerance at 2%. The 2016 notification indicated, among other things that, the key advantage around a target was that it would accommodate unanticipated short-term shocks even while nudging Inflation Expectations (IE) to the centre of the range to which monetary policy will return the economy over the medium term.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main role for monetary policy through a nominal anchor such as CPI is to deliver low and stable long run inflation and IE. Even as we have seen stable inflation since the start of FIT, IE continue to remain high and sticky. In this regard, it would be useful to look at the bi-monthly Household Inflation Expectations Survey published by the central bank. The key statistics here, include the 3 month and 1 year ahead median inflation expectations. Let's take a look at the data for 3 periods: May 2016 to March 2021 (first phase of FIT); April 2021 to March 2022 (second phase of FIT that concludes in March 2026); May 2016 to March 2022 (whole period till now where FIT has been implemented).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of the FIT, IE has remained above 7% persistently, which is 1% above the upper tolerance level of 6% and has been closer to the high single digits for both the 3 month and 1 year ahead IE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the whole period, while the minimum three month and one year ahead IE at 7.2 and 7.9 have been above the upper tolerance level of 6%, in the second phase of FIT the three month and one year ahead IE have been significantly higher than the upper tolerance level of 6%. It would be interesting to go to the root causes of such high IE in the backdrop of six years of a FIT regime. While food and fuel prices could be a proximate cause, could it be that past episodes, prior to FIT, of high and entrenched inflation has led to an element of IE stickiness. Could the trump card to escape this entrenched IE lie with increased productivity through fiscal policy, which can complement FIT? Clearly, the thrust by the government through capex could be beneficial and transformative in this regard. Even as productivity changes take time and are structural, near term cyclical dynamics call for restrictive monetary policy. The real rates are negative when adjusted for IE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been a considerable shift in inflation forecasts from 4.5% in the Feb policy (with risks characterised as broadly balanced) to 5.7% in the April policy. Given the structural up move in global commodity prices and supply chain effects, inflation in India could be in the region of 6% and above 6% for three successive quarters. A simple Taylor rule that captures inflation deviations from target; output gap and a real rate could provide some intuition to likely policy rate outcomes. \\r\\n\\r\\nRates could go above 6% based on policy or 7% based on an alternative forecast especially in the backdrop of CPI at 6.95% and WPI at 14.55%. It would be useful to hike rates soon rather than move from accommodative to neutral followed by policy action. In this regard the period October 2019 to February 2020 could be useful in that, policy moved to calibrated tightening in October 2019 which remained in February 2020 when rates were cut (and policy moved to neutral). The current environment calls for moves the other way around.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, since more liquidity is drained for 14 days which is characterised as the main operation it would be interesting to start thinking about a transition of the policy rate from overnight to a 14-day main operation rate in the backdrop of a tightening cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author is MD, global emerging markets, Deutsche Bank\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

The dues of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Srei Equipment Finance, run to Rs 724 crore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two Srei companies, with total outstanding dues of nearly Rs 32,000 crore are undergoing insolvency proceedings.

In Haryana, intermittent pre-monsoon rains have helped farmers to sow paddy crop. Paddy farmers in Bengal, too, are sowing.\\r\\n\\r\\naEURoeAs of today, monsoon has been decent for sowing soyabean crop, though in Malwa region there is lesser rainfall which is impacting sowing,aEUR said D N Pathak, executive director of Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA). aEURoeBut we have time till first week of July. If it rains in this fortnight, then sowing will pick up in the region too.aEUR\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to government data, as on June 10, kharif crop has been sown in 79.62 lakh hectares of land. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn last kharif, India had produced 127.20 lakh tonnes of soyabean, according to the first advance estimates of agriculture ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nKharif cotton sowing for the season in Gujarat is likely to increase by at least 15% compared to the previous season amid a rush to sow the crop well ahead of its schedule, industry executives said. Farmers had got good prices for cotton in domestic and international markets last season.\\r\\n\\r\\nVijay Setia, a basmati rice producer from Haryana, said there has been intermittent pre-monsoon rains in the state for last three to four days, which has helped farmers to sow the basmati crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bengal, the largest producer of non-basmati rice in the country, farmers have started sowing in places that have received good rainfall. aEURoeThere have been good rains in last three days. Farmers of Bengal had started sowing and the rains have added further momentum,aEUR said Subrata Mondol, general secretary of Burdwan District Rice Mills Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kharif 2021, India had produced 107.04 million tonnes of rice. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its forecast for next five days has said gradual maximum temperature is likely to rise by 2-4 degree centigrade over most parts of northwest India and Madhya Pradesh.

ANIMumbai: It is said that too much money chasing too few goods is inflationary. But that may be only partially true. Empirical results of a study by economists at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation in the presence of economic slack.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, implying that monetary accommodation during Covid-19 by the central bank needs to be reversed once the economy gets back to its normal path of growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known economist and Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman\\'s theory which guided monetary policy through the world in the second half of twentieth century said that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and it occurs when too much money chases too few goods. Excess money creation, or unrestrained expansion in the balance sheet size of a central bank, accordingly, has been cited as the prime driver of inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is changing since the turn of the twentieth century across the globe and the link between money supply and inflation is weakening - even in India. Empirical results suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation during an economic slack. When the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, said a research paper carried in the latest RBI bulletin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authors are Sitikantha Pattanaik, Binod B. Bhoi and Harendra Kumar Behera, from the Department of Economic and Policy Research. The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBI\\'s economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Empirical findings for India suggest that excess liquidity that does not lead to higher broad money growth is not inflationary,\" the authors said. \"Only a robust pick-up in demand that can absorb the surplus liquidity in the system could be inflationary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research assumes significance as central banks across the globe that were in quantitative easing mode post global financial crisis in 2008 and went on aggressively expanding their balance sheets are now going for quantitative tightening. Back home in India, the RBI is being criticised for falling behind the curve in its inflation fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authors say that higher money growth may counterbalance the contractionary impact of the velocity shock rather than pose risks to inflation. Also, Friedman\\'s theory is increasingly less likely to hold in the age of financial innovations, rising digital non-cash modes of payments for transactions and also in view of the emergence of FinTech for financial intermediation.\\r\\n\\r\\n', \"Building Wealth: Long-term investing is key to unlocking huge potential returns Looking only at the average market returns at a particular point in time may give a biased result.

At present, he is Director (strategy) at Estee Advisors and head of investments at Gulaq, a part of Estee Group.Investing in the stock market is becoming luring for people. Many of us think of it as a tool to get quickly rich. What investors lack is discipline and patience to stay in the market for the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stay invested for a longer tenure, one needs to understand the right way of observing the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market is no easy play, as not everything you see may be correct and vice versa.\\r\\nETMarkets Smart Talk: Srikanth Subramanian decodes factors that could derail momentum on D-St\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correct way to look at the market returns:\\r\\nWe usually look at average historical returns as a primary activity before investing. This way of finding better avenues to invest is not totally correct. It doesnaEUR(tm)t consider every factor about the returns, thus may give an incorrect picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking only at the average market returns at a particular point in time may give a biased result. You may end up having too high or too low expectations. Over a period of time, stock prices show volatility.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the ways to look at the market returns with accuracy is aEUR~Rolling returnsaEUR(tm). Rolling returns guide investors on the range of returns that are expected, showing the highest return, lowest return, and average return for a given time period.\\r\\n\\r\\nLetaEUR(tm)s understand the concept of Rolling returns by the following example.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at the image below, if you consider the period of one year beginning from January 2016 to December 2016, the market gave a return of 12% in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, an investor started investing in February 2016, his return was 20% at the end of one year in January 2017. Someone lucky might have started investing in March 2016 and completed one year in February 2017 with a return of 25%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, these different one-year periods show the series of possible market returns in a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nLooking only at the average returns may prove to be misguiding for the investors. The whole picture may differ. For example, the Nifty 50 gave a 14% average market return for the last five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not give the whole picture of an investor who has 5 years investment horizon. Another noteworthy thing is the highest return for five years was 75% and the lowest return for the five years was 2%.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, the time period of above five years has the lowest return in a positive number. Therefore, it is evident that the larger the time frame, the higher the possibility of positive returns and a low risk of losing capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefining tenure can be a subjective term for investing, but one can follow this general definition to understand the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do Long-term investing and Short-term investing mean?\\r\\nGenerally, Long-term investing means staying invested in any financial asset for more than one year. On the other hand, short-term investing means staying invested in the same financial asset for a period of lesser than one year. Though, these definitions are only correct from a taxation perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual definitions of long term and short term may differ for all of us. For some, it may be just a year, but for others, the long term can be 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nLooking at the above chart, we can see that there are almost 100% chance of positive returns if one stays invested for at least 5 years. Hence when thinking about investing for long term, one should have minimum time horizon of 5 years, though more the better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Long-term investing is a better option?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Less time-consuming\\r\\nOne of the major benefits of investing for the long-term is you do not need to constantly monitor your investment. In short-term investing, you constantly need to monitor the price movements. This requires more time and huge effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, long-term investing gives you a hassle-free experience. Once you selected the fundamentally strong stocks, you can choose to stay relaxed. You just need to periodically check their performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Higher returns due to compounding\\r\\nCompounding, which was called the aEUR~eighth wonder of the worldaEUR(tm) by Albert Einstein, has phenomenal power. This element enters into the game of long-term investing if dividends and stock returns over time are reinvested. The larger the investment horizon, the higher the power of compounding and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose Harshit and Ronak, and Meet invest Rs. 5,00,000 on the same day in the same stock and earn the same interest of 10%. All of them decided to stay invested for 12 years. Harshit thought of withdrawing the interest every year, whereas Ronak and Meet chose to reinvest the interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarshit who chose to withdraw the interest every year would receive Rs. 11,00,000 at the end of 12 years. Whereas, Ronak and Meet would receive Rs. 15, 69,214 at the end of 12 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Meet wants to stay invested for further 3 years and wants to keep reinvesting the interest. At the end of his 15 years of investment, he would receive Rs. 20,88,624 even with the same rate of interest. This shows the real power of compounding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No burden of timing the market\\r\\nShort-term investing requires a trader to time the market. The practice of timing the market can make huge money, on the one hand, the investors may end up losing huge on the other due to wrong anticipation. Due to the fact that the aEUR~Future is uncertainaEUR(tm), predicting the market exactly is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a long-term investor, you can be free of the stress of predicting future price movements and taking entry and exit decisions frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Negligible impact of short-term fluctuations\\r\\nPrice fluctuation is inherently in the nature of the stock market. This tends to bring in human emotions, and investors may end up taking wrong decisions looking at such fluctuations. The recent Russia vs Ukraine crisis is one example. aEUR~VolatilityaEUR(tm), which is a big part of the picture of short-term investing, is a very small part of long-term investing. The large picture of long-term investing allows investors to avoid such short-term fluctuations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoints to take care of when invested for the long term\\r\\nFollowing are the points you should take care of while invested for the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\naEURC/ Keeping yourself updated about the news is not bad but taking entry or exiting from funds on such short-term news can impact your long-term investment.\\r\\naEURC/ Do not expect to get your return doubled in a very short span of a month or even a year.\\r\\naEURC/ Do not think of beating the benchmarks, in terms of return, all the time. If you are investing with discipline and consistency, beating the benchmark would be of little account in the long term.\\r\\naEURC/ Do not make any decision with emotional bias or intuition. Rely more on data than anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, long-term investing is a key to unlocking huge potential returns. Though long-term investing is the plant that you do not need to water daily but taking care of it periodically is important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

It stayed in an upward trajectory throughout the day and kept marking incremental high points. Though it stayed sideways during the last half hour of the session, but largely maintained the gains.

The markets picked up steam the moment it was above 16,500. This level continued to see high put wiring activity during the day. Moving on from here, the Nifty is near the upper edge of the consolidation and any move above 16,700 will propel the markets higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as the Nifty is below 16700, it will stay in the broad 16,400-16,700 congestion zone and would trade with positive bias but will refrain from taking any sustainable directional bias. Friday is likely to see a stable start; the levels of 16,700 and 16,765 will act as immediate resistance points. The supports come in at 16,550 and 16,480 levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 53.31. It shows a mild bullish divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bullish and remains above the signal line. A bullish engulfing candle emerged on the charts; it may act as a potential onset of resumption of the up move for the index, subject to confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern analysis shows that the Nifty got a breakaway gap above 16400. However, after that it consolidated in a narrow zone and saw a classical throwback. It tested the levels from where it had broken out and it has tried to resume to up move. It has resistance near 16700; any move above that will propel the markets higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, the analysis remains on similar lines. If the markets have some mild profit taking or remain weak if weak global cues affect them, it is strongly recommended to refrain from creating fresh shorts. All dips, if any, must be used to make select purchases. While continuing to adopt a selective approach in the markets, profits too must be protected at higher levels unless the level of 16,700 is taken out comprehensively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, is a Consulting Technical Analyst and founder of EquityResearch.asia and ChartWizard.ae (ChartWizard, FZE) and is based at Vadodara.

On a weekly options expiry day, the Indian equities had a strong trending day as they opened strong, got better as the day progressed and ended the day on a strong note.

As the day progressed, the markets got even stronger. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe index, in the process, kept marking gradual incremental highs and managed to close near the high point of the day.

Since the markets opened well above that, they trended strongly towards the 17,400 levels. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest call writing was witnessed at this point and prevented the Nifty to stay a notch below this level.

The monthly options expiry data shows that the upsides may get capped near 17,500, which holds the maximum Call OI accumulation as of now.\\r\\n\\r\\n However, this is very indicative -- if the up move gets extended, then the price action of Nifty against the level of 17,500 will be crucial to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday is likely to see a quiet start to the day.

It would be annoying not to have your starting capital when that time comes,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the long-term record of shares is excellent but there is always a risk of a big fall over a short period and there is little protection in picking the most large, stable and aEUR~safeaEUR(tm) share, because if there is a general market decline, then blue chips will fall in line with the market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the whole, the stock market is not a good place for short-term, aEUR~hotaEUR(tm) money,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not over-diversify your portfolioKoch says investors should not over diversify their portfolio and never hold too many stocks as holding more than about 15 stocks does little to decrease risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, investors should know the companies they invest in extraordinarily well, which is very difficult if they invest in a large number of companies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is better to know a few things rather well, or one thing very well, than it is to know something about a lot of things,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says another reason for investing in fewer stocks is that inevitably investors will pause longer, think harder and weigh the buy or sell decision more carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will also be more vigilant in keeping an eye on them and will stand a much less chance of missing any necessity to sell, lighten or increase your holding. But how many is too many? It depends partly, but only partly, on the amount of time you have for your investments,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly invest if you are confidentKoch says before investing it is best to be confident about the medium and long-term prospects for the company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You should not invest because you consider the shares aEUR~a strong betaEUR(tm). You must first look at the company and assess, by numbers or otherwise, whether it has a good future of growth ahead of it (one good way to assess this is to look at its past). Then you must consider whether the shares are fairly priced, undervalued or overvalued. One of the advantages of having a small portfolio of five to ten stocks is that you will not be tempted to include a few aEUR~speculative long shotsaEUR(tm),\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever buy on tipsKoch says investors are probably approached from time to time by friends or acquaintances offering them aEUR~hot tipsaEUR(tm) based on rumours, or information close to the aEUR~insideaEUR(tm) but they should never, ever, buy shares as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For one thing, it just may be inside information, in which case you and your informant may be committing a criminal offence. But even if the use of insider information was made compulsory it is just not a sensible thing to do. You canaEUR(tm)t check the veracity or the importance of the data. In some cases, there may be a deliberate attempt to aEUR~rampaEUR(tm) the shares by those who have already bought and plan to sell soon. Tips belong on the race course, and even there they are usually wrong. Avoid them!,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not follow the crowdKoch says investors should resist the lure of going with a fad as investors could probably beat the majority of investors only by following a different path.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stick to your investment strategy for the period you have set and do not be put off by analysts or be seduced by recommendations. You must still convince yourself, of course, that you are right, but, unless you have important new information since you made your original decision, do not be moved,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever aEUR~average downaEUR(tm) when the price is fallingKoch says averaging down is an unsound principle which means adding to holding of a stock, investors already have at a lower price than they previously paid for it, to lower the average acquisition price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The price at which you first bought a stock is irrelevant to whether you should buy or sell now. The only issue is whether, with the information you now have, the company has a good future and the shares are undervalued. Only this should impel you to buy, or indeed to hold, a stock: if you cannot confidently say aEUR~yesaEUR(tm) to the two points above, then sell,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch has the following advice for investors if they are planning to average down -\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Only average down with extreme caution, and after much deliberation.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Do not do it more than once a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Only do it if you are sure the companyaEUR(tm)s future is good and the shares are undervalued.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Do not allow one stock to take up more than a quarter of the value of your portfolio (this is an absolute maximum, not a target).\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Never average down more than once for the same stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Never average down until the price has been stable or rising, with at least one dayaEUR(tm)s rise, for the previous three days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNever be afraid to sell at a lossKoch says some experts believe that investors should always discard the loss makers once they have fallen a predetermined amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If a share has fallen relative to the market as a whole (an important qualification), the onus is on you to say why you should keep it. You must have a good reason for doing so,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn from your experienceKoch says investors personal experience of investment, if analysed carefully, probably will show recurrent patterns of behaviour. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you divide your historic portfolio aEUR\" that is, all the shares you have owned aEUR\" into three categories, organised by the success or otherwise of the investments, itaEUR(tm)s likely that you will gain a lot of insight by asking what is common about all or some of the investments in each category. The aim is for you to categorise your investments as winners, losers and average (in all cases relative to the market), then to look at the winners and find a few common themes about them, either in terms of the types of company, how closely you know them, why you bought them, or any other common factors. Then repeat the process for the other two categories,\" he says. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not invest heavily when everyone else is doing the sameKoch says investors should not commit a lot of funds to the market when it is reasonably possible that the market is hitting a cyclical high.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, one way to avoid this is never to invest when the market is within 3 percent of a record high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBalance patience and prudenceKoch says there are two opposite schools of thought and approaches that investors can undertake while making an investment decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch one is the aEUR~long-termistaEUR(tm) approach which holds that there are almost no circumstances in which investors should sell shares in a aEUR~goodaEUR(tm) company. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this approach, the trick is to find a few such companies for the long term as an investor and then just stick with them. \\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the opposite philosophy is that markets are volatile and no one ever went broke by taking a profit. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which you prefer depends on how skilled you are likely to be at identifying even a few good companies. Not many people are good at doing this although, with the right training and encouragement to keep their eyes open, many more could be,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch says the best general position, though, may be three-quarters towards the aEUR~long termaEUR(tm) view.\\r\\n\\r\\nKoch lists some guidelines that may help investors make better investment decisions -\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Do not be too patient with your under-performers.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Decide in advance if you have a target selling price above your cost price.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Even if the share reaches the target price, continue to hold (nervously) until the shares run out of steam.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If you can afford to, do not set a target price and continue to hold your winners for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. If your shares double in value in a short time, and you are thinking of selling, sell only half (or, if you have to, three-quarters) and lock the rest away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Koch, beating the market is both possible and fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you fail: cut your losses. Hand your money management over to others and enjoy the rest of life. If you succeed, do something worthwhile with at least some of your wealth,\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: This article is based on Richard Koch\\'s book The Financial Times Guide to Selecting shares that perform.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT', 'A silver lining for FMCG firms in H2 amid rising inflation Electronics makers, however, said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment, and demand for entry-level products will remain under pressure over next few quarters. representative imageConsumer product companies expect a recovery in demand and profitability during the second half of the financial year due to good monsoon, elevated farm prices, fading inflationary pressures in the coming months, and the \\'low base\\' effect, even as they face slowing demand in the current quarter. Electronics makers, however, said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment, and demand for entry-level products will remain under pressure over next few quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Given the forecast for a normal monsoon this year coupled with a good harvest and farmers getting better prices for their crop, I am hopeful of a faster rural recovery. While there is an immediate pressure, we expect rural demand to recover by end-June this year,\" said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at Dabur India.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Jan-March quarter earnings performance, most companies blamed slowdown in the rural market for dragging the overall growth. However, expectations of a normal monsoon and elevated food prices have brightened the outlook for rural income in rabi and kharif season for FY23. In addition, non-agri wage growth has started to improve, up 4.2% in the second half of last fiscal after declining 0.5% in early FY22.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolume, or unit sales, of daily consumer products people bought fell 4.1% year on year during the March quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecline Sharper in Rural Areas \\r\\n During the quarter, shoppers cut back on household spending due to inflation and the Omicron wave dented sales, industry officials said, quoting Nielsen data. This was the second consecutive quarterly decline in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market after a 2.6% volume decline in the December quarter. The decline was sharper in rural areas that saw volume growth shrink by 5.3% during the March quarter while urban markets fell by 3.2%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarico Ltd managing director Saugata Gupta said FMCG market growth constituted a challenge in the near term due to high inflation and high base, but demand and volume growth should improve towards the end of the September quarter. \"This would be driven by the significant steps the government is taking to control inflation and lower base of the previous year. Even rural demand should improve in the next four to five months with projections of a normal monsoon and stability in inflation,\" said Gupta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government took a series of measures in order to cool inflationary pressures including reduced central excise duty on fuel, provide subsidy on gas cylinders and increased fertiliser subsidy. \"These interventions are likely to reduce inflation directly by 25 basis points, while indirect benefit can be another 25 bps. We expect inflation to average at 6-6.3% in FY23,\" said a recent report by Antique Broking. The lifting of a ban on palm oil export by Indonesia from Monday will aid margins too, which in turn, could slow down price increases that the companies have been making since several months.\\r\\n\\r\\n Emami Ltd vice chairman Mohan Goenka said while overall FMCG demand has been subdued, the summer products portfolio has registered double-digit growth for the first time in three years. \"Inflation is impacting the recovery, but we expect a recovery within the next two quarters. The government has already taken steps to control inflation and markets are wide open. If more stimulus is given by the government and there is normal monsoon, the recovery could be even earlier, including rural markets,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies, however, said a bulk of their growth could still be driven by price increases and not by greater unit sales, especially in discretionary categories. \"Consumers are getting impacted by inflation in almost everything they buy and consume. This will lead to conservation in the form of controlled consumption or downtrading in the next two quarters. While the impact on essentials will be marginal, other purchases may get postponed,\" said Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia Industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nGodrej Consumer Products said it anticipates a double-digit top line growth with low-single digit volume growth. \"Bottom line is hard to predict, but if the cost moderated to Malaysian ringgit 6,000 for palm oil, about 7% to 8% lower than where they are today and $100 for crude, we should see some margin expansion especially in the second half of the year,\" Sudhir Sitapati, managing director at Godrej Consumer Products, said during its earnings investor call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer Electronics\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consumer electronics industry had forecast a recovery of mass segment products and a revival in rural markets in the second half of this fiscal, but price increases of raw materials and consequentially final products will delay the recovery, industry executives said. Around 50-55% of the input cost are imported hence the industry expects prices will continue to go up by 5-6% every quarter. Prices have gone up by 10-12% already including the latest increase this month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Consumers of entry-level products are withholding discretionary purchases and buying electronic products only when there is a necessity. So the boom in AC and refrigerator purchases due to the heat wave may die down due to product price increases and overall inflationary environment,\" said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'Stock market update: Fertilisers stocks  up  as market  rises  The 30-share BSE Sensex was  up  520.68 points at 56338.79 Getty ImagesShrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said Nifty50 topping the 15,800 mark was completely unexpected.NEW DELHI: Fertilisers stocks were trading higher on Friday at 10:09AM \\r\\n\\r\\n Madhya Bharat Agro Products(up 3.57%), Sikko Industries(up 3.50%), Agro Phos(up 2.77%), Aries Agro(up 2.19%), Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers (up 1.77%), KRISHANA(up 1.72%), Coromandel International(up 1.33%), G S F C(up 1.28%), Madras Fertlizers(up 0.99%) and Khaitan Chemicals & Fertilizers(up 0.83%) were among the top gainers. \\r\\n\\r\\n Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chem(down 4.65%), Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers(down 1.77%) and ZUARIAGRO(down 0.49%) were among the top losers. \\r\\n\\r\\n The NSE Nifty50 index was trading 130.75 points up at 16758.75, while the 30-share BSE Sensex was up 520.68 points at 56338.79 at around 10:09AM. \\r\\n\\r\\n Infosys(up 2.85%), Reliance Industries(up 2.75%), Tech Mahindra(up 2.62%), HCL Technologies(up 2.6%), Wipro(up 2.37%), Larsen & Toubro(up 1.7%), Bajaj Finance(up 1.52%), SBI Life(up 1.25%), HDFC LIFE INSURANCE(up 1.07%) and Tata Consultancy(up 1.01%) were among the top gainers in the Nifty pack. \\r\\n\\r\\n On the other hand, Shree Cement(down 3.48%), Grasim Industries(down 3.32%), UltraTech Cement(down 3.3%), Britannia Industries(down 1.62%), Apollo Hospitals Enterprises(down 1.23%), NTPC(down 1.23%), Bharti Airtel(down 0.95%), Eicher Motors(down 0.8%), Asian Paints(down 0.63%) and Maruti Suzuki(down 0.57%) were trading in the re', 'These stocks are slated to suffer due to rising palm oil prices The rising inflation has been a major problem for FMCG, consumer and QSR sectors, which have been hiking the prices to absorb the impact.

But another price hike might be a major challenge for the companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalm oil is the world\\'s most widely used vegetable oil as it accounts for about 40 per cent of the supply of top four edible oils. Global palm oil production slumped in 2020 and 2021 due to a drop in migrant labour on plantations across Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Palm oil is the relatively cheaper oil amongst the other edible oils.

The export ban and increase in Malaysian taxes will further exacerbate the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nEchoing the similar views, Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that this turmoil will negatively affect FMCG companies like HUL, Nestle, Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products, Marico among others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The high prices will leave packaged food products manufacturers, soap manufacturers, and other personal care manufacturers with no other option than to raise prices and thus affecting their volumes,\" he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a step ahead, Prabhudas Lilladher said that palm oil is a key ingredient in the major food processing industry and QSRs, impacting their cost and margins.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe the impact would be seen most in categories such as biscuits, noodles, cakes, potato chips, frozen desserts,\" it added. \"QSRs like Westlife Development and Burger King can also feel the pinch given edible oil usage to cook/fry their patties/fries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe financial firm has a buy rating on the QSR firms like Westlife Development and Restaurant Brands Asia.

Volumes including clinker sales were down 2% YoY and up 2% QoQ at 7.8mnte. Factoring in higher cost escalations, it cuts CY22E-CY23E EBITDA by 16-3% and reduces target price to Rs2,615/sh (earlier: Rs2,710/sh) based on 11x MaraEUR(tm)24E EV/E. It maintains BUY.

Here\\'s why The storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well. Shyam SekharRelatedThis Mohammed Rafi song makes Shankar Sharma think of today\\'s marketWill the recent strength in retail flows into the stock market continue?ETMarkets Basics: All about PE ratio; 5 things to consider before making investment decisionNEW DELHI: Market veteran Shyam Sekhar says popular trends and themes in the market scares him and that for a reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nA popular trend draws millions of investors to specific themes in the market. But trends do change over time and chances are high that many retail investors who are invested in the popular \\'trend\\' may get trapped and find it difficult to shift to a new one, when that happens, leading to collateral damage. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a video posted on his YouTube channel ithoughtwealth, Sekhar said information in the past was limited and it was only through newspapers. Analysis was even lesser. The popularising of trend, he said, occurred under Harshad Mehta, who popularised the replacement cost theory and within no time everybody was calculating the replacement cost of everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat trend, he said, became so popular that it led to a bull market. Sekhar said his father, who was not usually interested in such trends, actually once asked him why he is not following the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, it reached people who were otherwise focused on their business activity.\\r\\nMORE STORIES FOR YOUaoe*This Mohammed Rafi song makes Shankar Sharma think of today\\'s marketWill the recent strength in retail flows into the stock market continue?ETMarkets Basics: All about PE ratio; 5 things to consider before making investment decisionA<< Back to recommendation storiesI don\\'t want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT\\r\\n\"It had reached people who were traders, people who were from other walks of life. So, the trend as a concept was created only to do this: bring in people who are not in the stock market, into the stock market, and make them very keenly interested in the trend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is so that whatever such investors do in the stock market will be within this trend. All the money will travel into the trend. Now, this is something which I found very scary,\" Sekhar added.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said when he entered the stock market, he wanted his investing to be insulated from such trends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted to do it in a place where valuation was justified and where the long-term potential would eventually protect my capital and grow it. But most people found the popular trend to be simple and straightforward. But, look what happened in Harshad Mehta time in 1994, also during the GDR boom; and in 2000 when we had dot com bust; it happened in 2008 when we had the infra boom and it also happened in 2018 in the smallcap boom. It is happening now again when we are having the micro-investing boom,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said thematic investing, which people like him used to escape from, is becoming a trend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a very difficult place to be because what you thought was an approach, which will keep you away from mistakes, is now the mistake because people are popularising a theme into a trend so that they can bring in more people. You also have this theme manifesting in different ways. You have multiple information sources for this. The popularising is happening through Telegram, WhatsApp and YouTube. It\\'s also happening through webinars,\" Sekhar said adding that is why stocks are getting re-rated so fast these days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I look at the bare mechanics of all this, how it all works, I see no difference between what operators like Harshad Mehta did in the early 90s. And then it happened again in 2002, during Ketan Parekh time. And again, during 2008 during the infra boom,\" he said. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So many chemical stocks, which I see today at peaks, can very well be in a very different place after 24 months. But the way it is told to you, the way you are fed with information and perspective, is such that there is only one side. There is no other side. This one-sided flow of information is the basic fuel to create a popular trend into which you can suck a million people. Regulation cannot do much,\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSekhar said investors need to protect themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Decide whether you want to buy options into cocaine or you want to buy a Satvik pill,\" he said. \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail investors should not get trapped and that is what regulators and everybody wants, he said adding that when collateral damage happens, the weakest ones get hit the most. \"This has happened in all cycles and it\\'s going to happen again,\" he warned.\\r\\n', 'Page Industries shares  decline  0.48% as Sensex  slides  A total of 228 shares changed hands on the counter till 01:24PM (IST) Getty ImagesIndia 10-year bond yield rose 0.05 per cent to 6.03 after trading in 6.02-6.04 range.Shares of the Page Industries Ltd. traded at Rs 38795.9 on BSE at 01:24PM (IST) on Thursday, down 0.48 per cent from previous close. \\r\\n\\r\\n The stock quoted a 52-week low price of Rs 29130.4 and a high of Rs 46705.0. \\r\\n\\r\\n Earlier, shares of the company saw a gap up opening in the morning. \\r\\nETMarkets Smart Talk: IndiaaEUR(tm)s investable landscape wider than other EMs despite premium valuations: Piyush Sharma\\r\\n A total of 228 lakh shares changed hands on the counter till 01:24PM (IST). \\r\\n\\r\\n The stock of Page Industries Ltd. commands a market value of Rs 43272.46 crore. \\r\\n\\r\\n The stock traded at a price-to-earning (P/E) multiple of 80.65, while the price-to-book value ratio stood at 44.25.

However, if the RBI was to raise rates more linked to higher-than-expected inflation, then we would see challenges for demand,\" said Prasad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BSE Realty index ended up 0.28% at 3,227.36 on Thursday and the Auto index gained 0.27% at 26,015.04, a day after the RBI increased a key policy rate by 50 basis points. In May, the central bank had raised the rate by 40 basis points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgenciesHemang Jani, head of equity strategy-broking and distribution at Motilal Oswal, said RBI rate hike was an event risk which has been factored in, so the rate hike itself is not a negative development for rate sensitive stocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Realty index is down 12% from April but the Auto index is up 8% since April. The Bank Nifty gained 0.4% to close at 35,085.45.\\r\\n\\r\\nSiddarth Bhamre, research head at Religare Securities, finds auto and real estate stocks a more attractive proposition than banks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After a 50-bps hike, we have not seen a major fall in auto or banking names. Within rate sensitives, the auto sector is well poised, the index is 5-6% away from all-time highs with technical chart breakouts and formation of bullish positions,\" said Bhamre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The correlation that rate sensitives should fall on rate hikes does not work every time,\" he added. Bhamre does not prefer banks as much as this interest rate increase is not because of growth but supply side factors.\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'This one factor holds a clue to when the worst FII selloff might end \"There are fundamental reasons behind FII selloff.

India was relatively expensive to start with and that has added some kind of fuel to the fire to the current account worsening for India as a consequence of the fuel prices rising and the consequent weakness to the currency,\" Raychaudhuri told ET NOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an investor, whose assets are denominated in US dollars or in euro, if you are anticipating the destination currency, in this case the Indian rupee, to depreciate maybe another 3 per cent to 5 per cent, you would obviously hesitate to put money in that market, he explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the Indian rupee trades at record low levels of 78.40 against the US dollar. Higher interest rates in the US and a consequently stronger dollar diminish the appeal of assets in riskier emerging markets such as India. A weaker rupee further erodes FPIsaEUR(tm) returns from Indian assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, the US Fed is likely to continue with steep rate hikes as suggested by its chief Jerome Powell. He during the Fed rate hike announcement earlier this month suggested that in order to combat inflation, the US central bank could hike the benchmark interest rate by another 0.75 percentage points in July. The Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by 75 bps - the biggest increase since 1994 - in June meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysts believe that a pause in Fed\\'s rate hike cycle is essential for FII outflows to reverse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rising inflation and resultant rate hikes by US Fed are the main reason behind the churn of FIIs from emerging markets to developed markets,\" said Hemang Jani, Head Equity Strategy, Broking and Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services in an interaction with ET NOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nFII selling may continue for a while till the aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed comes to a halt, Jani added.\\r\\n\\r\\nV K Vijaykumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial echoed similar views. He told ETMarkets that as long as the dollar and US bond yields appreciate, FIIs will continue to sell. \"They will stop selling only when dollar and bond yields stabilise, which in turn, will depend on US inflation rates and FedaEUR(tm)s policy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFIIs\\' return holds significance as any signs of a slowdown in selloff or reversal could indicate that the market bottom is likely in place and that D-Street is poised for another leg of the rally.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is difficult to predict the exact point when the tide for FII flows will change, ArunaGiri N of TrustLine Holdings suggests that the FII money will come back much sooner than FedaEUR(tm)s timeline for unwinding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not only it will be sooner, but it will be much larger than what went out.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.

It means that these companies need to rise more than 200 per cent to hit their previous highs.\\r\\n\\r\\nStocks like Paytm and Zomato have eroded more than two-third of their value from the 52-week highs. CarTrade is down by 62 per cent from its all time high, followed by PolicyBazaar, which is trading 52 per cent below its peak prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding more pain to the investors\\' scare, shares of Nykaa, Paytm, Zomato, PolicyBazaar and CarTrade Tech have wiped out more than 2.35 lakh crore of investors wealth from their peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaytm alone has eroded more than Rs 85,000 crore from investors kitty, whereas Zomato has contributed about Rs 60,000 crore.

They are warning investors to allocate minimal capital in these stocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nYash Gupta, Equity Research Analyst at Angel One, said the correction in the startup universe began with the fall in the tech heavy Nasdaq. Similarly, the stocks have seen a turnaround with a rebound in the Nasdaq.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are neutral towards India\\'s startup story at this point in time,\" he added. \"If there are long term investors who want to play the theme, can allocate a small fraction of their portfolio allocation to the story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the five previously listed startup stocks is trading above their issue price, with Nykaa being the only exception. Interestingly, Paytm and CarTrade did not visit their issue price even once.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajority of the global and brokerage firms have a positive outlook on the new age startup counters, with decent target price, which suggest strong upside in the counters.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal brokerage firm Goldman Sachs has a target price of Rs 1,070 on Paytm.

It noted that the company is moving in the right direction, but needs consistent execution to meet the high expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic brokerage firm ICICI Securities has a hold rating on \\'Nykaa\\' with a target price of Rs 1,250 as the competition in the e-BPC space further weakens the upside, whereas it has a \\'buy\\' rating of PB Fintech with a target price of Rs 776.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, not everyone is going all guns blazing the startup stocks. A few analysts said that despite the worst is over for these counters, there are serious concerns over cash flows and profitability of their companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAjit Mishra, VP- Research at Religare Broking, said that these companies are now looking to improve their operation performance and bottomline, but one should actually wait for this to turn into a reality before taking a call.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestors should be comfortable with valuations, along with growth prospects, cash flows and profitability, he added. \"One can allocate a small portion of capital in such stocks, if they wish, but it\\'s better to be late than taking undue risk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

AgenciesIndia's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. ETIntelligence Group: India's top steel companies are expected to take a hit on their profitability because of the increase in export duty. Domestic steel prices have fallen 8% since the duty was increased late last month and may correct further, say analysts, even though manufacturers had guided for a limited impact from the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, since the beginning of the ongoing fiscal year on April 1, domestic steel prices have come down by 17%, and are now below their year-ago levels. However, raw material prices remain elevated, which would weigh on the performance of steelmakers such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and SAIL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the fall in domestic prices is linked to the duty hike, as international steel prices (Chinese FOB prices) are down only 9% since April 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteel prices are currently around a,163,500 a tonne compared with a,167,000 in June last year. During the same period, the prices of key raw materials, coking coal and iron ore increased by 140% and 49%, respectively. This could lead to a sharp reduction in profitability for the steel manufacturers in FY23.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust to give a perspective, Ebitda/tonne for the March quarter for Tata Steel (India), JSW Steel, JSP and SAIL were lower by 30%, 48.5%, 47% and 55%, respectively, from their peak (in the quarter ended June 30, 2021). For Tata Steel, the impact was the least because it owns iron ore mines. The coming quarters could see a further deterioration in this performance, as analysts say the likely fall in exports due to the higher duty would not be offset by local consumption, as the domestic market cannot absorb the excess capacity created over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgencies\\r\\nIndia's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. The capacity has increased close to 7% over the past 15 years, while consumption has increased by a little over 5%. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn FY22, India exported 13.5 MT (18.5 MT including semifinished steel). Out of this close to 10.5 MT were of flat, cold-rolled and other value-added products. Companies have said on record that they will continue to export these value-added products, at the cost of their profitability, as they cannot stop business with clients developed over the years. The remaining 3 MT (8.5 MT including semifinished steel) will be routed to the domestic market, which will lead to higher local supplies and thus lower realisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings for steel companies are very sensitive to external factors. In the past, these companies have seen from going highly profitable to loss-making in less than a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopments over the past few weeks have left some analysts downgrading earnings estimates of the sector.

APWhile interest-rate hikes get all the press, an equally big problem for bulls is valuations, with years of price appreciation leaving equities and fixed-income at nosebleed altitudes relative to cash flows.The economic cycle is advancing to a point where valuations may finally matter again for stock and bond investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortress-like in their refusal to bend for the better part of a decade, both asset classes have come under pressure thanks to the ever-stiffening resolve of central banks to restore order to the global economy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe S&P 500 has dropped in five of the last six days while yields on 10-year Treasury notes is set to break a streak of seven straight increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile interest-rate hikes get all the press, an equally big problem for bulls is valuations, with years of price appreciation leaving equities and fixed-income at nosebleed altitudes relative to cash flows. \\r\\n\\r\\nA novel way of measuring the bloat was proffered in a note by JonesTrading, which added together the S&P 500aEUR(tm)s earnings yield and the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries. Combined, the total yield -- what the firm called its aEURoereverse Fed modelaEUR -- stands at 7.2% today, even with the runup in bond rates. ThataEUR(tm)s lower than 93% of the time since data began in 1962. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorse, income from the assets is dwindling due to inflation. With consumer-price increases running at 8.5%, itaEUR(tm)s the first time in six decades that the combined asset yields have sat below the inflation rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\naEURoeHistorically, investors have been more diligent to reprice stocks and bonds to ensure there is reward for taking on the added risk,aEUR Michael OaEUR(tm)Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in an interview. aEURoeThe market believes the Fed will blink at the first sign of asset price weakness.aEUR\\r\\n\\r\\nThat two major financial assets are so richly priced conceivably creates trouble for investors who just endured their worst quarter in decades, going by the breadth of losses across markets. Stocks and bonds have fallen this year in a rare concerted selloff as the Federal Reserve turned hawkish, embarking on whataEUR(tm)s expected to the most aggressive rate-hike cycle since 1994. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 4.4%, the S&P 500aEUR(tm)s earnings yield -- the higher-is-cheaper reciprocal of the more widely followed price-earnings ratio -- sports one of the lowest readings in decades. The rate on 10-year Treasuries, despite reaching a three-year high of 2.78% Monday, offers less than half what it has done historically. \\r\\n\\r\\nStocks look expensive as well based on other metrics. Roughly 17% of members in the Russell 3000 Index are trading at more than 10 times their revenues, a proportion that exceeded even the dot-com era, according data compiled by Strategas Securities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg\\r\\naEURoeWhile it is true that the share prices for many of the high flyers are down dramatically, there could be more room for them to decline,aEUR said Ryan Grabinski, a strategist at Strategas. aEURoeOne has to wonder how much investors will be willing to pay for these speculative names when the cost of capital is no longer free. Not to mention many of these companies produce zero profits and more often than not, require additional capital to fund their businesses.aEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nFor his aEURoereverse Fed model,aEUR OaEUR(tm)Rourke at JonesTrading adapted a framework that according to a July 1997 report by the central bank compares the relative value of stocks and bonds to identify a more attractive asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eyes of OaEUR(tm)Rourke, both assets are priced as if they are in a bubble, inflated by an unprecedented period of Fed monetary support. To prove his point, he summed up the yields from Treasuries and stocks to show how little investors are getting nowadays relative to history.\\r\\n\\r\\nT', \"Shares of Federal Bank  fall  as Nifty  drops  On the technical charts, the 200-day moving average of the stock stood at Rs 91.03.

But a decision will have to be made especially as a committee to evaluate this feasibility more than two years ago has submitted its report,\" said the CEO of a life insurance company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nine-member committee co-chaired by LIC chairman MR Kumar and former New India Assurance chairman G Srinivasan was formed in February 2020 to examine the feasibility and business scope for life insurance companies to offer indemnity-based health plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMORE STORIES FOR YOUaoe*Private sector general insurers lead market share growth in AprilMotor insurers asked to stop ads displaying services not part of coverLIC makes muted debut, lists at 9% discount on stock exchangesA<< Back to recommendation storiesI don\\'t want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT\"The committee had sent its recommendation more than one-and-a-half years ago. But since the life insurance members were outnumbered in the committee, all it could suggest was allowing life insurance companies to be distributors of health plans, though the demand has always been to enable life insurers to offer health because it is a natural combination rather than clubbing it with general insurance products like motor,\" said a member of the committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustry captains say a new chief at the Irdai along with the recent public listing of LIC could alter the status quo in the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new Irdai chairman wants things to move. But more importantly, since now LIC is listed, it is in the government\\'s interest to make sure it is profitable, and this is one way of doing it. Allowing LIC to offer health will open up a whole new segment, so the key is with the government. It is also important to see what are LIC\\'s views on this since previously they have been reluctant to venture into new areas as they were always under pressure to fulfil the government mandate,\" said the CEO cited above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllowing life insurers to offer health plans will dent the fortunes of standalone health insurers and general insurance companies. The regulator will also have to take into account their complaints, especially at a time when there has been increased awareness of these products post-Covid.\\r\\n\\r\\nA research paper by the National Insurance Academy released earlier this month said that health insurance premium collected has jumped to a,173,330 crore in FY22 from a,158,572 crore a year ago and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 24%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This has been a proposal which has been in the works but a decision has not been made yet. There are other issues which are also under consideration, so it is not as if this decision is next in line,\" said a senior Irdai official. The regulator could not be immediately reached for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the proposed reforms in life insurance are the standardisation of products and simplifying regulations, more specifically on calculations of management expenses for these companies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this move is probably more important because it has ramifications throughout the insurance industry,\" said the CEO cited above.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear whether Irdai would want to take a fresh look at health insurance or will rely on already existing submissions by previous committees in this regard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'GAIL shares  drop  2.17% as Sensex  rises  A total of 666,394 shares changed hands on the counter till 02:04PM (IST) Shutterstock.comIndia 10-year bond yield fell 0.34 per cent to 6.13 after trading in 6.13-6.16 range.Shares of the GAIL (India) Ltd. traded at Rs 162.05 on BSE at 02:04PM (IST) on Thursday, down 2.17 per cent.

It aEUR~feelsaEUR(tm) like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction, but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done. Shutterstock.comOne of the issues investors often lament during a market correction is how they could not sell at highs and create enough cash to start investing during bear markets. It is an interesting thought, but in todayaEUR(tm)s column, I intend to debunk the notion that large cash calls are critical to wealth creation. I will submit that cash calls have more to do with behavioural aspects rather than their statistical benefits when juxtaposed against their opportunity cost. I will conclude that, as investors, we are far better off focusing on investible businesses and the price we should pay for them, rather than inordinately worrying about cash calls. If that interests you, please read on!\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important distinction here is about the fundamental fabric of the economy in which we are making these decisions. An economy does well over a long time when (a) more people work, and (b) people work more efficiently (labour force participation and productivity gains). With people, ideally, we should measure effectiveness, and not efficiency, but I digress. In India, more than 90 million people will join the labour force over the next decade, and we are continuously finding more ways to be efficient. Accordingly, the conclusions for IndiaaEUR(tm)s investments will be different from what has transpired in Japan over the past three decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite that, retail investors in India own just 8% of the market (16% including mutual funds), but that constitutes an even smaller percentage of their overall savings. For a vast majority of retail investors, stock markets are no longer considered akin to gambling casinos, but we are still far away from where equities are a must-have allocation in oneaEUR(tm)s savings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, to this reading cohort, I donaEUR(tm)t have to enlist the benefits of equity as in an investible asset class, I will take it as a given. In that case, the only decision that we must make is regarding the approach. To me, using leverage is not sustainable as a universal strategy. Leverage makes us terribly path-dependent. If we buy a certain stock at 100 on leverage (the fair price of which we believe is 150), and the stock dips to 70 before it reaches 150, we might be forced to liquidate. We build an acceptable path (for leverage to sustain) based on what has happened in the past. But increasingly, things that have not happened in the past are happening all the time now (markets had never corrected 30% in a month before COVID, and no market recovery had happened in a straight line before 2021). And any strategy where ruin is a possible scenario, however low, the a priori probability is unlikely to yield long-term success across all practitioners (ergo, not a universal strategy. Works with a few, and we celebrate the winners. But those who leveraged and got wiped off, we donaEUR(tm)t know them!).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf IndiaaEUR(tm)s economy is on a strong fundamental foundation and equity as an asset class deserves allocation within our savings and leverage is not an alternative, the only question that remains to be answered is - should we always stay invested in the market, or keep getting in and out (either fully or partially aEUR\" aka, take large cash calls)?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chart below compares the long-term returns of an investor who managed to invest all their surplus at the absolute market bottom (dark red bar) versus an investor who kept investing regularly (grey bar). Despite the huge market correction in the Global Financial Crises (light red bar), the difference in long-term returns of both investors is not material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher value of the red bar over the grey bar is assuming that the investor can accurately time the market. The difference between the two bars then, is the benefit of cash calls, if you will. Now let us look at the costs. Over the last three decades (13,500 days), if an investor missed just the best 10 days of the market, the investor returns would have been 65% lower. Miss 30 days and returns fall by a whopping 92%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nPut another way, if an investor absolutely nails the market bottom, the advantage he gains is minuscule compared to the costs (65% and 92% lower returns). The risks are not commensurate for marginally higher returns, in my opinion. Why then, one would wonder, would investors focus so hard on taking these cash calls?\\r\\n\\r\\nI would submit that, for many, it is an emotional issue. Investors donaEUR(tm)t consciously calculate the difference in returns that their strategy (higher cash calls) generates but derive huge comfort and satisfaction when they are able to invest in market corrections. It aEUR~feelsaEUR(tm) like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction, but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would propose a different approach to cash calls. Rather than letting it be an input parameter (\\'markets are expensive, so letaEUR(tm)s create cashaEUR(tm)), let cash be an output of articulated actions. For us, a good business is a great investment only when we pay the right price for it. Admittedly, there are different ways to arrive at the aEURoeright priceaEUR (we use reverse discounted cash flows), but when the price of the businesses we own gets too high, and we do not get decent businesses to buy, thataEUR(tm)s when the cash percentage should increase. If that coincides with markets topping out, so be it. This approach will ensure an investoraEUR(tm)s mental bandwidth is utilized in arriving at the right business to own, and the right price to pay versus incessantly worrying about market movement and behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(The author is Co-Founder & Director, Buoyant Capital.)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Besides this, the Nifty so far has held the double bottom formed near the immediate low point of this range.

Balance sheet, it said, is stronger than ever with a high provision coverage ratio at 75 per cent, minimal stress and adequate coverage on one-time restructuring (OTR) pool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While loan growth was stronger, credit flow was largely led by corporate due to better utilisation levels.

Asset quality continued to improve, with NPAs declining sequentially and satisfactory performance on accounts coming out of moratorium. Credit cost for FY22 stood at 94 bps and the bank would like to contain it within 100 bps going forward.
